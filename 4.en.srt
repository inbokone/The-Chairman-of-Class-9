1
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:07,576
I said I wanted to live quietly,
but you couldn't understand me.

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,678
Enough!

3
00:00:32,035 --> 00:00:33,602
MOON SUNG-HYUN

4
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:37,608
KIM SHI-KYUNG

5
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,275
HYUN-SUK

6
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:45,780
HWANG HYE-JIN, CHA JUN-HYUK,
CHOI JI-HYE, LEE HYO-BIN

7
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:49,451
KIM KYUNG-MIN, KI HYUN-WOO,
KIM WON-HOON, LEE CHANG-HO

8
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,630
THE CHAIRMAN IS LEVEL 9

9
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:05,633
PLACES, CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

10
00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:07,000
Enough!

11
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,891
She's so cute.

12
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,863
Look at her skirt.
Did you come from the Joseon era?

13
00:01:19,301 --> 00:01:22,816
I'll pretend I didn't hear that,
so just go.

14
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,852
Hey, get out of here!
You don't understand?

15
00:01:26,563 --> 00:01:28,021
It's my last warning!

16
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:30,390
What is this crazy bitch doing?

17
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:34,328
What will you do?

18
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:44,907
She's so funny!

19
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:47,562
Do you want to do at least
one piece of Taegeuk?

20
00:01:59,374 --> 00:02:01,121
Damn!

21
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:18,105
Stop smoking.
It weakens your body.

22
00:02:24,114 --> 00:02:28,645
As expected, the taekwondo master
saved the day.

23
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:31,051
Taekwondo master?

24
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:36,456
When Ba-tang was young, she won
all the gold medals in taekwondo.

25
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,760
Who are they?

26
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:44,164
- Yi-soo, are you okay?
- Yes.

27
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,638
- Are you really okay?
- Yes.

28
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,675
Even though I saw it with my own eyes,
I still can't believe it.

29
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,596
Her feet...

30
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:00,747
Na Yi-soo!

31
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:05,218
Wow, why are you surprised?

32
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:06,920
Me?

33
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:09,167
I'm not.

34
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:13,060
What they did yesterday?

35
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,729
Why did they want to beat you up?

36
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,330
They?

37
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,101
They are my old school mates.
Don't worry about them.

38
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:26,373
I actually thought
you were a bit weird.

39
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,539
I wondered why you were
acting so strong.

40
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:35,184
Now I think I know why.

41
00:03:37,202 --> 00:03:38,562
What do you know?

42
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,739
Is it because of them?

43
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,400
What?

44
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:49,329
Did they bully you at your old school?

45
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,233
What did you say?

46
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:55,168
They bullied me?

47
00:03:55,658 --> 00:03:57,090
What a nonsense...

48
00:03:57,123 --> 00:04:00,240
It's okay.
You don't have to tell me. I get it.

49
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:02,008
It's not your fault.

50
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:06,680
You're at Balhae High School now,
you don't have to worry anymore.

51
00:04:07,095 --> 00:04:08,826
You know it, right?

52
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:13,019
Don't keep your problems to yourself,
let me know if I can help.

53
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:14,554
Because I will help you.

54
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:19,326
- Why do you think...
- See?

55
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:21,728
You don't have to act strong.

56
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:24,664
Na Yi-soo!

57
00:04:24,996 --> 00:04:27,100
I kept calling you.
Didn't you hear me?

58
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:32,372
No, I'm hearing something absurd...

59
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:33,598
Here.

60
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:36,631
What is this?

61
00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:41,284
While I was packing my lunch,
I packed one for you, too.

62
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:43,950
Why?

63
00:04:44,692 --> 00:04:45,692
Because...

64
00:04:47,394 --> 00:04:50,658
Thanks to you, I can live
without feeling bad.

65
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:55,662
Is it okay for you
if we have lunch together?

66
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,401
I was worried for no reason.

67
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:08,033
- Sure.
- Really?

68
00:05:09,587 --> 00:05:12,779
"A free life makes me crave for more."

69
00:05:13,215 --> 00:05:16,683
What does the author mean
by the free life here?

70
00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:20,261
Na Yi-soo!

71
00:05:21,272 --> 00:05:22,389
Na Yi-soo!

72
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,724
Na Yi...

73
00:05:25,296 --> 00:05:26,326
Yes?

74
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,454
"A free life makes me crave for more."

75
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:32,165
What is the free life the author
is talking about here?

76
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,690
Life is...

77
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:39,487
Isn't it originally free?

78
00:05:45,723 --> 00:05:47,969
So what will the subject
of that longing be?

79
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,417
Craving?

80
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,853
I know what is survive...

81
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:02,829
Miss Baek. What's wrong?

82
00:06:03,098 --> 00:06:04,064
Did something happen?

83
00:06:06,912 --> 00:06:09,069
You know Na-Yi Soo,
the transfer student.

84
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:11,304
- He's weird, right?
- He's weird.

85
00:06:11,397 --> 00:06:14,674
It's weird, right? He's so handsome.

86
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:17,077
It's not about it.

87
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:21,214
I'm not the only one
who feel that way.

88
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:22,649
Na Yi-soo?

89
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,484
He's really weird.

90
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:28,955
He's not good
at listening or speaking.

91
00:06:29,944 --> 00:06:33,693
The old chairman was an irreplaceable
figure at Balhae High School.

92
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,264
After the chairman was changed,
the class got a little weird.

93
00:06:37,725 --> 00:06:40,091
Some kid seems become a mess.

94
00:06:40,124 --> 00:06:43,942
And the timing is aligned
with Na Yi-soo's transfer.

95
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:45,038
Is it weird?

96
00:06:45,585 --> 00:06:46,707
So, maybe...

97
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:53,748
What is the relation between
Na Yi-soo and the new chairman?

98
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,588
What kind of relation?

99
00:07:01,764 --> 00:07:04,491
Mister Thomas watches
too much K-dramas.

100
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:08,395
No one knows who the new chairman is,
so how could Na Yi-soo know him?

101
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,287
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

102
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:15,168
Hey!

103
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:16,836
Hey!

104
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:19,842
Why?

105
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:25,745
I tried to just ignore it,
but as the person sitting next to you,...

106
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:29,387
...and as a classmate,
I can't just ignore it.

107
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,082
I don't know what it is,
but just ignore it.

108
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,360
Let's go.

109
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,308
Imo Military Rebellion in 1882!

110
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,220
Gapsin Coup 1884!

111
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,355
The sine function of Y over R!

112
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:55,417
X cosine function in R!
Y tangent function over X!

113
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,714
All Right! Do justice too!

114
00:07:57,747 --> 00:08:01,801
Enough evaluation!
Handle it right!

115
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,420
Hey, what are you doing?
Being alone and awkward...

116
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:10,857
What the hell is this?

117
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:15,829
I made this because I thought
it could help us study.

118
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:18,031
How is it? Can you memorize it well?

119
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:21,601
You guys are really amazing.

120
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:23,526
Look amazing!

121
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:25,401
Done! It!

122
00:08:25,434 --> 00:08:26,495
Fall to ruin!

123
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:28,417
Explode it!

124
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,573
One more time!

125
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:31,495
Explode it!

126
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:32,902
Explode it!

127
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:50,897
Does it taste bad?

128
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:52,999
No.

129
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:54,601
It's good.

130
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:56,669
Why?

131
00:08:57,346 --> 00:08:59,439
School doesn't go as messy
as you wanted?

132
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:02,275
How did you know?

133
00:09:03,956 --> 00:09:05,545
You told me.

134
00:09:06,924 --> 00:09:08,948
You want to ruin this school.

135
00:09:11,346 --> 00:09:13,520
At this time, your voice is loud...

136
00:09:17,831 --> 00:09:19,959
Why? Do I have to keep it secret?

137
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:29,102
Isnâ€™t this ruining things amazingly?

138
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:35,477
After you ruined our school lunch,
everyone started to have lunch outside.

139
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,413
Those rich kids don't want
to eat this kind of food.

140
00:09:40,938 --> 00:09:43,716
Only us, social worker kids,
who eat their lunch here.

141
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:14,349
BP - BIG PICTURE

142
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:20,720
I thought you were doing well.
Is there any problem?

143
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,555
You already knew, right?

144
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:26,259
Doesn't any high school let you graduate
just by your presence in class?

145
00:10:28,138 --> 00:10:29,896
For regular schools, yes.

146
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:32,724
However, the school guidelines
of Balhae High School...

147
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,135
...are meant to ensure that
not a single student falls behind.

148
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:40,406
So, if my grades are bad,
I can't graduate?

149
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,943
Most of students who enter Balhae High
rarely receive bad grades.

150
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:49,516
The chairman is a special case.

151
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,988
So it was the reason why Balhae High
was handed down to me.

152
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:57,423
But you see me wrong.

153
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,593
Do you think it will
make me study hard?

154
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,498
Who likes school anyway?

155
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:09,102
I'm gonna drop out of this
crappy school right now!

156
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,241
Na Yi-soo.

157
00:11:15,531 --> 00:11:16,976
It's been a long time.

158
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,345
Yeah.

159
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:22,265
Are you doing alright?

160
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:24,469
What...

161
00:11:25,766 --> 00:11:28,639
I guess many things have happened
since the last time we met, huh?

162
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,657
This uniform doesn't fit you.

163
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:35,895
After what happened to your father,
you came to your senses?

164
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:37,997
There's no way...

165
00:11:39,109 --> 00:11:43,203
At this time, I think you look more
like your mother than your father.

166
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,439
You are still the same.

167
00:11:47,678 --> 00:11:49,909
You just say anything without thinking.

168
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:51,644
What did you say?

169
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:54,514
That's why you didn't get
privileges as an eldest son.

170
00:11:56,906 --> 00:11:57,906
This kid...

171
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:02,088
You became more rude
since the last time I saw you.

172
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:05,825
What is the reason an eldest son
doesn't get privileges in Korea?

173
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:12,031
Either he can't work
or his private life is too dirty to cover.

174
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,968
Have you finished talking?

175
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:19,194
- It is both, isn't it?
- Crazy brat...

176
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:23,009
I got this position because
my father's life was cut short...

177
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:26,512
...and not because of my own effort.

178
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:27,880
Now please.

179
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,386
I have a midterm exam soon,
so I have to go.

180
00:12:36,326 --> 00:12:38,491
Because I'm not good at studying.

181
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:43,329
Where did such a thuggish behavior
come from?

182
00:12:44,037 --> 00:12:45,326
Spoilt brat!

183
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:56,776
Expel him from school.

184
00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:58,111
Yes?

185
00:12:58,434 --> 00:13:00,299
We don't mean that...

186
00:13:00,332 --> 00:13:04,150
Chairman. The school disciplinary
committee has not officially opened.

187
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:07,754
I run a school,
but I can't teach my own son.

188
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,123
I am very sorry
that such a scandal occurred.

189
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,493
- What do you want to do right now?
- Please calm down.

190
00:13:13,621 --> 00:13:17,263
Why should I be expelled from school?
They started it, not me!

191
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,502
It's because I didn't teach him well.

192
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,324
No, Chairman...
There's no need to do this.

193
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,007
Aren't we family?

194
00:13:28,832 --> 00:13:31,283
Even if everyone in the world
is against me,

195
00:13:31,316 --> 00:13:33,413
my father should be on my side!

196
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:35,205
Sit down. The adults are talking.

197
00:13:35,238 --> 00:13:39,018
Shit! Even if you're an adult,
you can't make a decision like this!

198
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,311
NA SEONG, BIG PICTURE CHAIRMAN
DONATE 10 BILLION WON SCHOLARSHIP

199
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,829
Shit, burning ten billion won
on scholarships?

200
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,498
Rich people are different from us.

201
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,008
What would you do
if you had ten billion?

202
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:57,470
I would spend it to have fun.

203
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:06,064
Put out your cigarettes.

204
00:14:07,524 --> 00:14:10,822
- What?
- Is this kid crazy?

205
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:16,219
It's a non-smoking area.
You two are adults.

206
00:14:16,252 --> 00:14:19,792
I didn't expect to be scolded
by a school kid.

207
00:14:20,322 --> 00:14:21,602
Do you want die?

208
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:23,796
Hey!

209
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:26,866
Hey! Are you fully awake?

210
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:36,019
Damn!

211
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:40,813
If you are an adult, act like an adult!

212
00:14:41,128 --> 00:14:43,886
What have I done? Why?

213
00:14:52,404 --> 00:14:55,395
<i>Although he was respected</i>
<i>by everyone in the world,</i>

214
00:14:55,968 --> 00:15:02,034
<i>for me, he was extremely selfish.</i>

215
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:07,140
<i>Even in the last moment before</i>
<i>his death, he still didn't trust me.</i>

216
00:15:14,068 --> 00:15:16,115
Why are you walking around in the rain?

217
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,284
Didnâ€™t you hear itâ€™s going to rain today?

218
00:15:22,716 --> 00:15:23,722
What?

219
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:25,224
Those kids bullied you again?

220
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,732
Or you're afraid of failing exam,
but you pretend like you don't care?

221
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,004
It's not that.

222
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:41,475
What kind of person
do you think I am?

223

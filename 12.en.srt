1
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:17,023
How did this happen?

2
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:25,693
What happened!

3
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,711
It's all because of you!

4
00:00:29,468 --> 00:00:30,464
What?

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,368
Don't come to my house again!

6
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,027

KIM WON-HOON, LEE CHANG-HO

11
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:26,787
THE CHAIRMAN IS LEVEL 9

12
00:01:29,825 --> 00:01:32,793
Places, characters, institutions
and events in this drama are fictitious.

13
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,095
Please...

14
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:40,701
Why you don't understand?

15
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:43,704
The owner of this building
has changed.

16
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,074
Therefore, it is okay to clean it all up.

17
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,277
Mom!

18
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:57,784
Sir, we can negotiate this.

19
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,724
If you do this to us, how can we...

20
00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:03,056
This is none of my business.

21
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,427
If you're that curious,
why don't you call the owner?

22
00:02:07,963 --> 00:02:10,497
I will try my best to explain it to him.

23
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,735
- If you tell me his number...
- Maybe it's someone you know well?

24
00:02:16,572 --> 00:02:17,572
What?

25
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,708
Na Yi-soo...

26
00:02:26,783 --> 00:02:27,971
You didn't know that?

27
00:02:28,363 --> 00:02:29,549
You didn't know.

28
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,096
Hey, she didn't know.

29
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,190
Isn't he the heir of Big Picture?

30
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,868
We would like to inform you that
Chairman Na Jun has been elected...

31
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,989
...as the new chairman of
Big Picture, a school corporation,...

32
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:56,243
...with more than half members
agreeing to the election.

33
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:00,217
Wait!

34
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:08,455
I am against the election.

35
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:13,360
And I am asking you
for re-appointment.

36
00:03:16,048 --> 00:03:17,431
What are you doing now?

37
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,000
You expect me to do nothing?

38
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,973
I am the current chairman
of Big Picture, a school corporation,...

39
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,876
...Na Yi-soo.

40
00:03:30,452 --> 00:03:34,789
What? That kid is the chairman?

41
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:37,117
Please be quiet.

42
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:41,655
Then, this vote is one vote short
of a majority.

43
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:44,224
So we postpone the voting.

44
00:03:44,693 --> 00:03:48,589
The voting will be held
at Balhae High School.

45
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,422
Hey, isn't it great
that the nutritionist is back...

46
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:21,728
...and our old school lunch is back?

47
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:27,434
So, Yi-soo was behind that
Marine camp meals for us.

48
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:32,425
Let's call him Voldemort.

49
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,609
Just call him Na-Yi-soo,
not Voldemort.

50
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:42,207
Then, Yi-soo can't go back to school?

51
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,688
Everyone would hate it if they found out
a high school student was the chairman.

52
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,780
Ba-tang!

53
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,939
If you want to apologize, that's fine.

54
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,910
We can't believe anything
we say between us anyway.

55
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:14,648
I know it may sound like an excuse,
but there is nothing I can do.

56
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:18,451
I did that because I was so scared.

57
00:05:19,747 --> 00:05:23,023
I did that so Se-ra wouldn't
bother me anymore.

58
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:28,528
I thought we were on a same boat...

59
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:32,332
...but you still believe that
everything can be solved with lies?

60
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,378
A YEAR AGO

61
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:51,418
Hello!

62
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:55,921
Hi!

63
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:03,597
Then, have you been to Africa?

64
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:07,234
It would be faster to find a place
I've never been to.

65
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,537
Wow, I'm jealous.

66
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,806
I still don't have a passport.

67
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:14,407
Really?

68
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,480
Are you Son Eun-bin?

69
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,188
Let go of me.

70
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:30,690
You don't have to lie to me.

71
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:34,160
I have nothing to say, so let it go.

72
00:06:34,484 --> 00:06:37,097
What were you ashamed of
so you lied to me?

73
00:06:38,756 --> 00:06:42,335
How will you survive here for three years
as a student from lower class?

74
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:05,292
Still, I thought you had
no malicious intent to me.

75
00:07:06,234 --> 00:07:08,194
I never thought you would
do this to me again.

76
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:13,066
I don't care if you hate me!

77
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:17,938
But don’t hate Yi-soo.

78
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:20,907
Because he didn't do anything wrong.

79
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:33,842
The school foundation
is having a hard time now.

80
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,519
They say it will be difficult
to give free tuition...

81
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:41,027
...for the students who
receive social assistance.

82
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,563
How can this happen so suddenly?

83
00:07:44,582 --> 00:07:47,067
I will try to find a way for you.

84
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,203
Isn’t it senseless for me
to endure this much?

85
00:07:51,312 --> 00:07:54,137
Ba-tang. It's not like that...

86
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:55,608
Thank you for all this time.

87
00:08:14,312 --> 00:08:18,431
I have said this.
Yi-soo is the chairman.

88
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
So what?

89
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:24,921
It's only a matter of time before
President Na-Jun becomes the chairman.

90
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,018
Master...

91
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:40,787
We don't have much time
until the vote.

92
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,390
So are you going to sit there
doing nothing?

93
00:08:44,697 --> 00:08:49,095
Does everyone say that I am too young
and unsuitable to be the chairman?

94
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:54,801
Moreover, I have gone around
threatening to destroy the school.

95
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:59,072
It would be a good chance
for reappointment.

96
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,410
You've been singing about
refunds and exchanges.

97
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,780
But now you really want
Balhae High School.

98
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:08,882
Yes.

99
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:12,185
Now I truly want to become one.

100
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:14,654
The chairman.

101
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,071
It helped me learn
a lot of things I didn't know.

102
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:25,598
It's about time.

103
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,735
Wait a moment.

104
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:43,937
When your father decided that
you would become the chairman...

105
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,354
...he asked me to give you this gift.

106
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:06,584
Mom...

107
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:20,019
Today, my one and only son...

108
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:26,726
...wants me to make
his favorite tteokbokki.

109
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:30,430
Because a mother
can't just sit by and watch.

110
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:32,925
- Are you filming it good?
- Yes.

111
00:10:45,304 --> 00:10:48,905
What's happening?
The brake isn't working...

112
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,780
Perhaps that was the last message
that your father left.

113
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,749
Did you have a nice dream?

114
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:07,594
I feel refreshed because I slept so well.

115
00:12:09,535 --> 00:12:10,496
Glad to hear that.

116
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:13,266
From now on, you will need
to get some sleep.

117
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,177
AGENDA FOR CHAIRMAN'S DISMISSAL

118
00:12:23,227 --> 00:12:24,043
Everyone!

119
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:28,781
School is a place that
responsible for a person's life.

120
00:12:29,637 --> 00:12:34,798
Can you leave a place like that
in the hand of 18-year-old chairman?

121
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:38,425
A guy like him?

122
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:44,697
No matter how much the world has changed,
running a school is still a business.

123
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:50,530
Leave it to a management expert
to stop the big spending...

124
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:54,608
...by the foundation which is
causing problems for us.

125
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,762
Right. What a good speech.

126
00:12:57,751 --> 00:13:04,720
AGENDA FOR CHAIRMAN'S DISMISSAL

127
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,987
I know that many people are worried...

128
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:15,476
...to entrust this school
to an 18-year-old.

129
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,131
So maybe that's why...

130
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:24,237
...my father wanted me to be graduated
from high school as the requirement.

131
00:13:26,082 --> 00:13:26,973
Yes.

132
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:30,841
I am still an immature
and inadequate person.

133
00:13:32,118 --> 00:13:36,128
A lot of things happened while I was
running the school for several months.

134
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,598
Because of my ambition,
I got ruined here and there.

135
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:44,324
As you said...

136
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,860
...school is a place that responsible
for a person's life.

137
00:13:48,598 --> 00:13:51,892
So where did you learn
that at schools...

138
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:57,181
...the rich have privilege,
and the poor don't have anything?

139
00:14:00,687 --> 00:14:04,010
The chairman is the person
who responsible for management.

140
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:06,436
That's right.

141
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:09,648
But at the same time...

142
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:13,548
...we are also educators who must
develop good character in our students.

143
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,361
We know that business
at school is important.

144
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:24,080
We also know that a school's reputation
is determined by the grades.

145
00:14:25,428 --> 00:14:30,384
But is it true that schools
only exist for business?

146
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:36,900
At school, we spend a lot of time
with our friends...

147
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:40,642
...and sometimes we fight.

148
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,181
I think we can share our daily lives
and even experiences...

149
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,494
...and many emotions from society.

150
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:55,658
I won't say that I'm a great educator.

151
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,876
Even a guy like me
who only got 9th grade...

152
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:06,908
...was able to avoid failing with the help
from my friends and teacher.

153
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,564
I think Balhae High School is a place...

154
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,509
...where less fortunate students…

155
00:15:17,008 --> 00:15:19,218
…can work hard and get first place.

156
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:24,525
It doesn't matter if I am dismissed
as chairman of the board.

157
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:26,859
But...

158
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:34,462
...I hope these aspects of
Balhae High School are maintained.

159
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:42,449
AGENDA FOR CHAIRMAN'S DISMISSAL

160
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:45,900
Good morning.

161
00:15:46,301 --> 00:15:49,657
I worked as a contract teacher
at Balhae High School before...

162
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:54,611
...and recently became a full-time
teacher, my name is Baek Jo-hee.

163
00:15:57,548 --> 00:15:58,548
I...

164
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,995
After received
President Na-jun's suggestion...

165
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,897
...I made a wrong decision.

166
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,239
Teacher Yoo didn't do his job so well.

167
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:17,199
Teacher Baek, this is your last year?

168
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:21,151
Yes. My contract
will be expired this year.

169
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,811
Do teachers move to another school
if they are unable to secure...

170
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:27,979
...a full-time contract after
completing their two-year contract?

171
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:32,358
Yes. Perhaps it should be that way.

172
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:37,597
So, we just do like this.

173
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,208
What kind...

174
00:16:45,228 --> 00:16:46,772
The Chairman told me...

175
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:52,465
...to ignore everything that happened
to Teacher Yoo that day.

176
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:59,719
In return, I received the position
of full-time teacher.

177
00:17:00,702 --> 00:17:03,164
How can it be....

178
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:06,946
Where did they learn
all this strange stuff?

179
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:10,696
Do you think you could solve
everything by lying?

180
00:17:10,818 --> 00:17:12,164
I asked her to do that.

181
00:17:12,729 --> 00:17:14,641
Do you think she's lying now?

182
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:19,477
This vote is meaningless. It's been
five minutes since this started.

183
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:22,075
Do I have to deal with this nonsense?

184
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:24,376
I lost both of my parents!

185
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:29,180
They both died
in separate car accidents.

186
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,353
This is something that rarely
happened to other people.

187
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,258
Why did it only happen to me twice?

188
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,530
The day before
my father passed away...

189
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,258
...and the day before
my mother passed away...

190
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,273
...you've switched the cars
that have just been inspected, right?

191
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:56,943
So?

192
00:17:57,601 --> 00:18:00,313
And so I think I should tell them
about you used the school foundation...

193
00:18:00,432 --> 00:18:01,881
...to raise a slush fund.

194
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:04,784
Do you have any proof?

195
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:11,667
From now on, I will speak as a lawyer.

196
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,460
- Attorney Hwang...
- What's going on?

197
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:15,625
What's going on?

198
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,502
Oh, my God, what is that?

199
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:24,604
What is that?

200
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:31,978
This is a case data that has been hidden
due to suspicion of additional crimes.

201
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:36,415
If this information had been known
to the world earlier...

202
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,930
...maybe, instead of Chairman Na-seong...

203
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,090
...Na Yi-soo would be the target.

204
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:51,213
We ask the dismissal of Na Jun,
Vice President of Big Picture...

205
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:55,821
…on charges of conspiracy to commit
murder and creating a slush fund!

206
00:18:58,001 --> 00:18:59,772
Stop it, you bastard!

207
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:02,831
I am no longer speaking as a lawyer
for Big Picture...

208
00:19:02,864 --> 00:19:05,289
...but as a lawyer for Na Yi-soo.

209
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:09,096
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop it.

210
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:11,350
Oh God, do something.

211
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,920
- Principal!
- Teacher, please!

212
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,020
Oh my God!

213
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,122
I told you to stop them!

214
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,125
If this keeps up, he'll...

215
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:32,074
COURT ISSUES ARREST WARRANT FOR
CHAIRMAN NA-JUN OF BIG PICTURE.

216
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:43,015
Welcome back.

217
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:45,435
Chairman, you already came?

218
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,289
Isn’t it moist?

219
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:53,292
Thanks to you, I got sponsored
this time. It's for you.

220
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:58,397
Hey, is that something that
all students have?

221
00:19:59,166 --> 00:19:59,966
Hey...

222
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:02,001
...you're not happy that I’m back?

223
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,130
Now is not the time for that.

224
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:08,507
I am the chairman.

225
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:12,474
If you fail again, your chairmanship
will be canceled.

226
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:21,333
Finally, I returned to school.

227
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:27,093
Terrible morning school time.

228
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:31,936
Although a miserable time awaits me
in the classroom...

229
00:20:31,961 --> 00:20:33,370
What is it called?

230
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:35,000
Be the best!

231
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:37,436
Na Yi-soo, don't look.

232
00:20:39,432 --> 00:20:43,003
Okay, after that...

233
00:20:43,432 --> 00:20:45,027
...in Korean expressions...

234
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:50,854
This is the precious time
that I will miss someday.

235
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:06,749
Are you not doing your job properly?

236
00:22:15,213 --> 00:22:18,371
What else is wrong with you today?

237
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:23,767
When it comes to schools, shouldn’t
everyone able to enjoy education equally?

238
00:22:24,228 --> 00:22:29,095
Some people carry books in their bags,
while others carry them in pads.

239
00:22:30,193 --> 00:22:33,583
So, do you want to give
each person one pad?

240
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:35,931
Yes.

241
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,225
You're going to use it
as a YouTube machine anyway.

242
00:22:41,258 --> 00:22:44,542
For me, YouTube is both
a teacher and a friend!

243
00:22:44,575 --> 00:22:46,453
A teacher and a friend...

244
00:22:46,486 --> 00:22:48,286
It's not convincing enough.

245
00:22:50,017 --> 00:22:53,009
Seriously, as soon as I graduate,
I'm going to fire you first.

246
00:22:55,701 --> 00:22:57,501
Are you threatening me now?

247
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,941
Whether it’s level 1 or level 9...

248
00:23:05,974 --> 00:23:10,478
I like myself the way I am, right now.

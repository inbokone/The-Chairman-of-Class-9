1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:03,671
While I'm being nice, apologize.

2
00:00:05,211 --> 00:00:06,507
Who are you?

3
00:00:07,468 --> 00:00:09,204
The best that you've been looking for.

4
00:00:09,953 --> 00:00:11,345
Follow me to the rooftop.

5
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:32,698
MOON SUNG-HYUN

6
00:00:35,223 --> 00:00:36,700
KIM SHI-KYUNG

7
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:39,328
HYUN-SUK

8
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:44,224
HWANG HYE-JIN, CHA JUN-HYUK,
CHOI JI-HYE, LEE HYO-BIN

9
00:00:44,863 --> 00:00:48,542
KIM KYUNG-MIN, KI HYUN-WOO,
KIM WON-HOON, LEE CHANG-HO

10
00:00:56,176 --> 00:00:58,716
THE CHAIRMAN IS LEVEL 9

11
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:04,707
<i>PLACES, CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS</i>
<i>AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.</i>

12
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:11,505
There's not much time left in class,
so let's finish it quickly.

13
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,876
Is it okay if I do my best
regardless of who I am dealing with?

14
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,145
Of course. Do as you usually do.

15
00:01:18,388 --> 00:01:20,314
This school is so much fun.

16
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:32,492
Are you ready?

17
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,362
If you cry or bleed, you lose.

18
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:38,131
I’ll finish it before you see blood.

19
00:01:43,614 --> 00:01:45,637
Hey!

20
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,418
What are you doing?

21
00:01:57,825 --> 00:01:59,853
Okay, this is the first question.

22
00:02:00,364 --> 00:02:03,552
This is a fund that manages funds
from a small number of investors.

23
00:02:03,585 --> 00:02:05,787
Unlike the funds managed
by financial institutions,...

24
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,854
…it takes the form of a contract
between signatures.

25
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:09,934
Not subject to supervision
by financial regulators,...

26
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:11,896
…unlike public fund, no restriction
on management…

27
00:02:11,929 --> 00:02:15,636
…so they can be operated freely.
What is the name of this fund?

28
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:20,229
What, what did you say?

29
00:02:20,262 --> 00:02:22,678
This is from a small number
of investors...

30
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:23,844
That's not it.

31
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:25,946
This is a foul!

32
00:02:26,943 --> 00:02:28,382
Why is that a foul?

33
00:02:29,553 --> 00:02:31,351
In Korea, you have to speak Korean.

34
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,661
Wasn’t it all in Korean
from beginning to end?

35
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:38,725
Isn't it too easy for the first game?

36
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,294
Okay. The answer is...
Please listen to it!

37
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,467
Samo...

38
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,259
What is Samo Fund?

39
00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:52,472
It already explained
in the question earlier.

40
00:02:52,942 --> 00:02:55,676
That fluffy white puppy?

41
00:02:56,295 --> 00:02:59,406
That is Samoyed.

42
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:05,018
Aren't these guys completely crazy?

43
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:10,658
I came here because
you challenged me…

44
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,793
…just to do this quiz?

45
00:03:18,642 --> 00:03:19,800
You laughed?

46
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:21,334
You saw it?

47
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:24,171
I was about to hold it, I'm sorry.

48
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:28,208
This is how everything is done here...

49
00:03:29,114 --> 00:03:31,945
Instead of doing something like this,
why not try a proper fight?

50
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,471
Yup, it's not bad.

51
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,918
Now, you finally understand.

52
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:42,756
How to say pi one digit at a time?
Breaking passwords with coding? Or...

53
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,591
Guess the year of Korean history?

54
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:48,395
Do I look like I'm joking right now?

55
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:01,621
With Na Yi-soo's forfeit,
Han Ba-tang wins this match!

56
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:05,956
Ba-tang is the best!

57
00:04:11,277 --> 00:04:13,587
The more I think about it,
the more absurd it becomes.

58
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:17,958
I asked them to fight,
and they gave me a mean quiz?

59
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:21,228
This is a rule that the Chairman
made during his lifetime.

60
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,349
At an age full of competition,…

61
00:04:23,382 --> 00:04:26,133
…the most fair way to fight
is without violence!

62
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:29,499
Isn't it fun?

63
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:33,940
I knew he would come up
with this idea.

64
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,511
That's how old guys would think.

65
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:40,956
Because he was more serious
about the school than anyone else.

66
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,993
A school where all students
can attend without worry!

67
00:04:45,103 --> 00:04:46,353
That kind of school.

68
00:04:46,876 --> 00:04:50,190
Kids here say,
"Instead of fight, we do quiz!"

69
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,492
How will you accept it?

70
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,728
Is he the transfer student?

71
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:58,398
He just started here, but he already
got ripped off by Han Ba-tang.

72
00:04:58,732 --> 00:04:59,980
Those brats...

73
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:01,268
Please keep in mind.

74
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,237
If a school violence committee
is held like last time…

75
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,373
…there is nothing I can do.

76
00:05:07,283 --> 00:05:09,476
So, please do your best.

77
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,050
I tried to give some tension
to these idiots…

78
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:20,253
…but my pride got hurt instead.

79
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,223
Just wait.

80
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:28,062
I'll throw you into the abyss
along with this damn school.

81
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,099
What do you see?
Give it to me!

82
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:37,771
If you bump into me,
you have to apologize first.

83
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:39,840
Eun-bin...

84
00:05:51,745 --> 00:05:55,021
It's a national rule not to be rude
just because you study a bit.

85
00:06:02,034 --> 00:06:03,063
What is this?

86
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:06,933
I was wondering if eating something
sweet would make you feel better.

87
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,537
Are you really a pushover?

88
00:06:11,023 --> 00:06:11,938
Ho-kyu.

89
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:13,806
Damn it.

90
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,710
Why are you act cute?

91
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:18,913
I said that's my name.

92
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,747
I'm Ho-kyu. Seok Ho-kyu.

93
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,283
That's right.

94
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:25,986
Everyone here is abnormal.

95
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,159
Hey, Ho-gu.

96
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:34,895
Me?

97
00:06:35,924 --> 00:06:37,130
Are you close with her?

98
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:40,200
Who?

99
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:41,401
Ba-tang?

100
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,370
We are all close friends.

101
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:46,157
Tell me all everything
you know about her.

102
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,810
There is a word like this in baseball.
Five tool player.

103
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,712
Just speak plainly.

104
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,714
Ba-tang is that kind of kid.

105
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:57,884
Perfection itself, without any flaw.

106
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:00,734
She was able to become
our school president…

107
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,622
…with an overwhelming
approval rating.

108
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,064
No, that's not what I mean.

109
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,431
Is there any weakness or crack
or something like that?

110
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:13,600
No, she doesn't have it.

111
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:16,992
How in the world is there
a person like that?

112
00:07:18,102 --> 00:07:20,444
Maybe Ba-tang is not a human.

113
00:07:20,549 --> 00:07:22,042
Because she's too perfect.

114
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,494
It's crazy.

115
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,811
Do you like her?

116
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:25,963
Yeah!

117
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:29,749
Wait, why is everything
so easy for this guy?

118
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,983
Yi-soo, maybe you will like her too.

119
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:33,053
Me?

120
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:34,421
Like her?

121
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,923
Don't say something nonsense!

122
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:42,382
So, today I want to talk to you
about the educational system.

123
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:44,731
And...

124
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,533
I want to ask you...

125
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:50,370
<i>Every hour is a hell like this.</i>

126
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:53,340
<i>I will die before the school collapse.</i>

127
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,777
Mister Na Yi-soo?

128
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,282
Yes?

129
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,784
What do you think
society will do...

130
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,206
<i>What did he say?</i>

131
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:06,953
...with educational system of today?

132
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:08,488
Yes.

133
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,890
Yes?

134
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:12,892
No.

135
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:13,994
No?

136
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,597
I believe that we need an education
that could allow us…

137
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:26,539
…to change individual opinions
rather than one direction answer.

138
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:29,709
It's because we all have the right
to enjoy our life…

139
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:31,429
…and do all we want to do.

140
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,114
Great answer.

141
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:36,544
The form is crazy, huh?

142
00:08:52,913 --> 00:08:54,200
What is this?

143
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:56,236
What do you mean?

144
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,873
Is this your first time
seeing lobster in a school lunch?

145
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:02,675
How can you make a profit?

146
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,545
Why are you worry about it?

147
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:10,083
The chairman didn't spare the money
on school food because of his love.

148
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:11,856
Love?

149
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:17,223
It is difficult to make school meals
with ingredients of this quality…

150
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:19,526
…unless you love the students.

151
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:23,081
The highest quality lobster
imported from Canada…

152
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,743
…and organic vegetables
to keep you healthy…

153
00:09:25,776 --> 00:09:30,236
…then eggs from chickens that
grew up listening to classical music...

154
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,372
Ro-woon, are you here?

155
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,111
Are you already using
the app I made for you?

156
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:40,980
Oh, after using that app,
calculations became much easier.

157
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:43,650
If you need something, please tell me.

158
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:46,719
Ro-woon, you can eat two lobsters.

159
00:09:48,851 --> 00:09:50,891
- Thank you.
- Okay, enjoy your food.

160
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:51,924
Yes!

161
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:58,431
No matter how you look at it,
isn’t it strange?

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,234
The only English he can speak
is yes and no...

163
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,924
…so how could he move
to our school?

164
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,139
Hey, he must be nervous
since it's the first day.

165
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:10,343
And a true master doesn't fight
at full power from the beginning.

166
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,546
But, doesn’t he seem
like a really fun kid?

167
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,484
I really don't get
your sense of humour.

168
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:21,254
For starters, he has a cute face.

169
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,124
She starts again.

170
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:28,461
Just looking at him gives you
adrenaline, dopamine, and oxytocin.

171
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,631
You know that tremendous amount of
energy comes from your brain, right?

172
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:35,969
You know that good looks
are always new and exciting?

173
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:39,139
Be careful, you could be
addicted to dopamine.

174
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,341
So what if he's handsome?

175
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,811
That kid is a bit rough.

176
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,146
Really?

177
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,583
He doesn't seem like a bad kid.

178
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:54,554
Hey, is it okay for him
to grab your collar?

179
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:55,889
It's just...

180
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,958
I thought he's a bit clumsy
with his expressions.

181
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:02,362
You are amazing, too.

182
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:06,399
If you let him do that to you twice,
I'm going to throw you a sharp punch.

183
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,069
Normally, all boys at this age
are like that.

184
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:11,638
Want to act strong and look like
they are doing well!

185
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,340
What about Ro-woon?
He's not like that!

186
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,811
This kid is a quite unique case.

187
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:26,057
Mi-sol, you are particularly
weak to bad boys.

188
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,955
Bad boys, you said?

189
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,859
<i>Homme fatale!</i>

190
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,297
Either way, Na Yi-soo is not good.

191
00:11:37,714 --> 00:11:41,434
Our school wouldn't fail after
the chairman died like people said.

192
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:44,204
But because of the kids like him.

193
00:11:54,571 --> 00:11:57,050
You don't give up so easily, I see.

194
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,719
Do you think you and I
can really be friends?

195
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:01,521
Yeah.

196
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,425
I really hate talking to people
while I'm eating.

197
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,362
So don't say anything.

198
00:12:15,062 --> 00:12:18,269
You think you can win my heart
with food all the time.

199
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:20,039
I am not an easy guy.

200
00:12:22,671 --> 00:12:23,576
Do you know?

201
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:28,181
In theory, lobsters have the ability
to live forever.

202
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:33,007
The more a lobster molts, the stronger
and harder its shell becomes.

203
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:35,188
I didn't ask.

204
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:40,360
However, if they keep molting,
they'll get tired and give up.

205
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:41,913
Do you know why?

206
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,364
I don't want to know.

207
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:47,734
They don't have the strength
to take off the hardened shell.

208
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,469
Isn't it so sad?

209
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:54,173
The longer you live, the more you
have to molt your hard shell.

210
00:12:55,243 --> 00:12:57,548
Stop it, you're making me
lose my appetite.

211
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,920
<i>This taste doesn't match</i>
<i>with the silver plate.</i>

212
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,056
UMAMI

213
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,723
<i>This is not a school lunch!</i>

214
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:12,679
UMAMI

215
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:15,424
It's tasty, right?

216
00:13:17,477 --> 00:13:20,466
All the kids here are pampered
with this school lunch.

217
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:25,506
There is even a social media account
about Balhae High's school lunches.

218
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,876
Even when the study gets tough,
we always look forward to this.

219
00:13:33,753 --> 00:13:38,151
In other words, this is the soul food
for Balhae High's students, right?

220
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:41,587
Yeah. What do you think?
It's good you moved here, right?

221
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:50,496
Nice!

222
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,198
Yeah.

223
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,301
My life has been good recently.

224
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,339
There's no one who tells me
to do this and that.

225
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:02,342
Okay, here we go again.

226
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:06,312
Who is it this time?

227
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:09,282
No one should call me at this time.

228
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:15,188
CHAIRMAN

229
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,221
Chairman...

230
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,089
<i>Are you the principal?</i>

231
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,394
<i>I am the new chairman.</i>

232
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,831
Chairman, I should meet you
in person and say hello.

233
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,266
This will do for now.
That's right, I'm the principal.

234
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,341
<i>Are you laughing right now?</i>

235
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:31,404
What?

236
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,860
Does lobster make sense
for a school lunch?

237
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:36,909
Are we a charity group?

238
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:38,611
That is...

239
00:14:38,772 --> 00:14:42,851
The former chairman told us
to support students with food…

240
00:14:42,884 --> 00:14:45,154
…without sparing anything.

241
00:14:45,187 --> 00:14:47,387
That bastard chairman, chairman…

242
00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:50,089
<i>…Who owns the school now, principal?</i>

243
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,526
Yes, well... Of course
the new chairman...

244
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:56,229
Change your meal service vendor
starting tomorrow.

245
00:14:56,763 --> 00:15:01,033
<i>What? We can't do that overnight.</i>

246
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:03,002
<i>We also need to select the company.</i>

247
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:06,106
Considering the price estimate
and other things...

248
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:08,969
Just do what I say!
Why are you talking so much?

249
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:14,881
There's one outfit I know well.
We'll use their service tomorrow.

250
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:17,850
School is a business too…

251
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,053
Do you know that the principal’s
salary also comes from there?

252
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:27,093
Chairman.

253
00:15:27,572 --> 00:15:28,694
Chairman!

254
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:48,581
Are we having a special event
or something like that today?

255
00:15:50,406 --> 00:15:53,419
Don't play around and give us
a proper meal.

256
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:57,889
I hate people
who play around with food.

257
00:15:57,976 --> 00:15:59,926
Do I look like I'm joking right now?

258
00:16:01,218 --> 00:16:05,798
Eat quickly!
Don't leave any leftover!

259
00:16:07,344 --> 00:16:11,237
The new chairman said that spending
on school meals is too much...

260
00:16:11,328 --> 00:16:13,105
I guess he changed
the catering company.

261
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:14,740
What did you say?

262
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,110
Then the company that bid
the lowest price…

263
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:21,347
…was the catering company
for the marine corps.

264
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:27,186
Gosh, really!
What are you doing?

265
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:29,689
Student! Take a seat.

266
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:31,791
Just bear with it!

267
00:16:32,496 --> 00:16:34,961
If you want to play military,
redraft yourself!

268
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:36,929
Is this a school or a marine camp?

269
00:16:37,932 --> 00:16:39,783
I'm losing appetite.

270
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:44,837
CHAIRMAN'S ROOM

271
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,073
Chairman!

272
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:51,544
Please come out if you're in there!

273
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:54,596
Chairman!

274
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:01,087
You can't let the kids
having what they want.

275
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:04,957
They need to toughen up
so they don't complain about the lunch.

276
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:18,704
What is it this time?

277
00:17:57,764 --> 00:17:59,066
That's crazy.

278
00:17:59,115 --> 00:18:01,537
Koo Se-ra, your class is different.

279
00:18:02,912 --> 00:18:07,019
After I called my mom, she sent
our hotel chef here right away.

280
00:18:07,543 --> 00:18:09,723
Who wants to eat
that school lunch anyway?

281
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:15,695
So, he is the chef of the famous
three Michelin stars SR Hotel?

282
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,063
That's right.

283
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,173
Eun-bin!

284
00:18:35,854 --> 00:18:38,017
Eun-bin, have you eaten?

285
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,686
Not yet.

286
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,823
Because I'm treating you today,
so enjoy your food.

287
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,626
Oh, thank you.
I will enjoy the food.

288
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,229
So, tomorrow Eun-bin will treat us too?

289
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:51,631
What?

290
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,667
Guys! Eun-bin
will treat us tommorow!

291
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:56,591
Wow, really?

292
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,037
Se-ra, wait a minute.

293
00:18:58,111 --> 00:18:59,105
Eun-bin.

294
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:05,811
Your father gets his monthly paycheck
from our company

295
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:07,672
Can’t you even do this much?

296
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:09,882
How much he get it?

297
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,319
Not much.

298
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:16,357
You know how much social workers get.

299
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:19,191
Eun-bin!
You must study hard.

300
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:22,357
I wonder how worried your father
must be as he lives a hard life.

301
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,799
Since your condition is hard,
how about one Michelin star food?

302
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,367
- Agree?
- Yes!

303
00:19:30,978 --> 00:19:31,978
Eun-bin.

304
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:39,046
You can live and wear this uniform
thanks to our company.

305
00:19:41,837 --> 00:19:44,684
So you should smile a little.

306
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:50,623
You are not like your father.

307
00:19:52,305 --> 00:19:55,761
Whenever he sees me, your father
is so polite and well behaved.

308
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:58,384
He always give me deep bow.

309
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:01,984
I don't expect that from you.

310
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:04,837
Just smile is enough.

311
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,336
Don't spoil the mood.

312
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:15,781
Koo se-ra. What are you doing?

313
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,594
You gotta like the most prestigious
private schools.

314
00:20:29,463 --> 00:20:31,997
Everything smells the same everywhere.

315
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:39,672
Our student president.
Did you finish your meal?

316
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,415
If you haven't eaten,
go ahead and eat.

317
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:47,680
Because I still have that much
to give to our president.

318
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:52,852
You can have lunch with your friends,
but know your boundaries, okay?

319
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:54,053
Boundaries?

320
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,188
What kind of boundaries?

321
00:20:56,657 --> 00:21:00,793
You don't want to get a warning
from the school disciplinary committee.

322
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:02,328
What?

323
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:09,001
I thought that would be fun,
but nothing happened, right?

324
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:14,840
So, as the student president,
what would you do in that situation?

325
00:21:15,242 --> 00:21:17,543
Why? Do you want to be
the student president?

326
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,814
You saw it with your own eyes
during the election…

327
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:23,749
…how the others thought about you.

328
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:27,820
You are being blinded because you think
the whole world is watching you.

329
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:31,023
Why are you bringing it up now?

330
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:35,895
A kid like you who goes to school
and have lunch for free…

331
00:21:36,476 --> 00:21:38,998
…doesn't have a right
to tell me what to do.

332
00:21:42,124 --> 00:21:43,135
Thank you.

333
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,687
Thanks to you, my school life is so fun.

334
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,475
Crazy bitch! Come here!

335
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:50,843
I said come here!

00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:01,802
<i>Who are you?</i>

2
00:00:01,992 --> 00:00:05,905
<i>Why did you suddenly appear</i>
<i>and annoys people with your antics?</i>

3
00:00:07,104 --> 00:00:09,076
<i>Die. Just die!</i>

KIM KYUNG-MIN, KI HYUN-WOO,
KIM WON-HOON, LEE CHANG-HO

9
00:00:51,822 --> 00:00:54,319
THE CHAIRMAN IS LEVEL 9

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,325
PLACES, CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

11
00:01:00,358 --> 00:01:02,443
Die. Just die!

12
00:01:11,856 --> 00:01:14,408
Some people live comfortably
in this world.

13
00:01:15,348 --> 00:01:17,444
Whatever you do, it's always
someone else's fault.

14
00:01:18,147 --> 00:01:19,780
It's never your fault, right?

15
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:21,990
This kid!

16
00:01:22,023 --> 00:01:24,786
I don't want to do this
to a great teacher like you...

17
00:01:26,263 --> 00:01:28,488
Otherwise, I think I will
go to heaven first.

18
00:01:29,504 --> 00:01:30,857
That's also not polite.

19
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:32,793
Damn you!

20
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:34,528
Teacher!

21
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,911
- It's him!
- Teacher.

22
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:39,833
He hit me!

23
00:01:40,102 --> 00:01:41,335
What have you done?

24
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:42,803
What's happening

25
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:49,376
It has never happened
since the school opened.

26
00:01:49,472 --> 00:01:51,511
No matter how poor
the teaching quality is...

27
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,648
...a student must not
put a teacher in this situation!

28
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,651
No, Teacher Yoo strangled me first!

29
00:01:58,033 --> 00:01:59,393
Can't you see it?

30
00:02:01,023 --> 00:02:02,023
Is it true?

31
00:02:04,827 --> 00:02:06,627
Why don't you say anything?

32
00:02:08,217 --> 00:02:11,064
I was upset.

33
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:13,333
Okay. Teacher Yoo,
please explain the whole story.

34
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:15,902
That guy just recklessly
attacked you, right?

35
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:18,405
Yes. He was suddenly...

36
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:20,173
Should I tell everything here?

37
00:02:21,038 --> 00:02:23,819
About a terrible thing he did
to one of his students?

38
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,119
Na Yi-soo! Watch your mouth!

39
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,883
It's up to you to decide.

40
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,520
Should the whole school
know about this...

41
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:36,957
…or we'll treat it
as a small deviation...

42
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,526
...and everyone return
to their positions?

43
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,567
Damn!

44
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:52,709
I sent this arrogant bastard to school
so he'll come to his senses...

45
00:02:52,742 --> 00:02:54,508
...but he's still causing trouble!

46
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:57,424
You can discuss it first.

47
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:01,982
You're an educated man, but you speak
with your hand before your mouth.

48
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:06,620
I heard you wasted a lot of money
when you were young.

49
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:08,822
I will teach you some manner...

50
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:11,525
Let go! Let go of me, will you?

51
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:15,162
People envy me for having a silver spoon
in my mouth when I was born.

52
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:18,932
But I feel really bad for being born
into this lowly family.

53
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:20,300
What?

54
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,173
I also think my quick temper
is hereditary.

55
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:26,083
But I can't show it to you.

56
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,184
Damn!

57
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,841
Damn!

58
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,967
ANNOUNCEMENT
FINAL SEMESTER EXAM REDO

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,360
If it's a retest, Ba-tang don't have
to fall into the failing class, right?

60
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,563
I'm glad to hear it, Ba-tang.

61
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,184
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

62
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,573
Step aside!

63
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:03,510
What are you talking about?

64
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:06,813
Shameless bitch! Don't pretend
that you don't know!

65
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:11,017
This exam redo,
it's because of you, isn't it?

66
00:04:15,282 --> 00:04:16,962
What do you want to hear?

67
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:21,161
If you take the test again,
you can get first place.

68
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,331
Why? Are you not confident?

69
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,167
- You bitch!
- Stop it!

70
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,902
Stop it!
You better stop, Se-ra!

71
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,637
Why do I need to stop?

72
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,774
We all will take re-exam
because of her!

73
00:04:34,985 --> 00:04:37,144
Hey, tell me.

74
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,981
Why should we redo the exam
because of this bitch?

75
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:43,359
Tell me!

76
00:04:44,674 --> 00:04:46,019
Bastard!

77
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,394
She's really annoying.

78
00:04:54,952 --> 00:04:57,297
- Hey, bitch!
- Se-ra.

79
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:00,400
You are annoying too, really!

80
00:05:10,446 --> 00:05:11,444
Hey, are you okay?

81
00:05:12,453 --> 00:05:14,381
I heard Koo Se-ra confronted you.

82
00:05:16,797 --> 00:05:19,853
She thinks she's entitled
to be number one student.

83
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:26,226
I'm sorry, but I need to go.

84
00:05:33,164 --> 00:05:34,668
Yi-soo, what are you doing today?

85
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:41,141
Even if I tell you, you won't get it.

86
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:42,976
About what?

87
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:47,714
I mean this school.

88
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:58,692
Redo the exam?
Do you think it makes sense?

89
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,630
It looks like Teacher Yoo
has caused some problems.

90
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:08,154
I asked him to do this
because I heard he is smart.

91
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:11,894
It seems I misjudged him.

92
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:26,286
You all probably know
what kind of school Balhae High is.

93
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:30,357
An aristocratic school that goes
beyond prestigious schools.

94
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:36,863
But the top student in that school
is a girl who receives social assistance.

95
00:06:39,052 --> 00:06:43,278
Will the numerous high-ranking
officials and conglomerates...

96
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:45,739
...who entrust their children
to our school be able to save face?

97
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,307
That's right.

98
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,311
But Ba-tang became
a role model to his friends...

99
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:57,050
...because of her academic achievements
and her friendly nature.

100
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:03,657
Teacher Baek still has little experience,
so she lacks a sense of reality.

101
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,125
Please kindly understand.

102
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:09,554
Teacher Baek.

103
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,434
It's not that hard
to understand someone.

104
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:21,209
Pay attention to what kind
of answer this person wants...

105
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:23,677
...and read the room
when you have a toast.

106
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,378
Am I right?

107
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,480
Yes.

108
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,114
Yes.

109
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:29,983
Okay.

110
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:34,022
Teacher Yoo,
do you want to drink with me?

111
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:37,862
I can't refuse when my senior
offer me a drink.

112
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:45,238
It's so good.

113
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,043
♪ Dear, don't be worry about anything ♪

114
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:03,316
It's such a shame.

115
00:08:03,844 --> 00:08:04,751
What?

116
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:11,324
A brilliant teacher like you
has to work with a small salary.

117
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,793
It's okay.

118
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:19,499
When you become the chairman,
you should give us a good bonus!

119
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:27,140
It depends on how you do it,
you may score a big bonus.

120
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:31,478
I can do everything
that you ask me to do.

121
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,248
Two hundred million.

122
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,188
Three hundred million
when the work is finished.

123
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,357
A total bonus of 500 million won.

124
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,562
What I need to do?

125
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,273
- You came early.
- Yes.

126
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,880
Ba-tang, can you get
my laptop from my car?

127
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,748
The principal is looking for me.

128
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:11,484
- Yes!
- Thank you.

129
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:36,420
Because of you,
things got a little complicated.

130
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:39,913
Sorry. I'm really ashamed.

131
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:44,584
After all this, you don't feel
ashamed to teach at school?

132
00:09:46,076 --> 00:09:47,153
Yes?

133
00:09:47,616 --> 00:09:50,857
For the time being, don't open
your mouth and act like you're dead.

134
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:52,960
So...

135
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:55,895
What about the remaining
300 million won?

136
00:09:59,977 --> 00:10:00,977
Teacher Yoo.

137
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,204
You're not good at counting.

138
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:08,708
I said I would give it to you
if you finish the job well, allright?

139
00:10:09,534 --> 00:10:10,610
No...

140
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:14,214
If I have to stop working as a teacher
and go into hiding...

141
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,950
...shouldn't you give me
some compensation?

142
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:23,256
That makes sense...

143
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:27,060
When I think about it now...

144
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:33,994
...you still have some work
left to do at school.

145
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:43,243
Se-ra...

146
00:10:43,382 --> 00:10:46,913
So why did you ask Teacher Yoo
to get into this situation?

147
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:48,448
What will you do now?

148
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:52,452
I'm as upset as you are.

149
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:54,420
What is the solution if you're upset?

150
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:59,726
I posted everything about
my party and shopping.

151
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,050
I wrote on my social media
I was the number one student.

152
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:04,197
And now you're asking me
to make some excuses.

153
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:07,714
- If you try harder next time...
- What the f*ck!

154
00:11:07,816 --> 00:11:10,770
Why should I try harder? Why?

155
00:11:11,262 --> 00:11:14,807
I wish she is disappeared.
Why can’t you do that simple thing?

156
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,311
Okay! I will try again!

157
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:21,414
I will do it. Don't cry.

158
00:11:23,134 --> 00:11:25,785
If you cry, I'll go crazy.

159
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,059
BALHAE HIGH SCHOOL

160
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,062
Hey, Na Yi-soo.

161
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:37,964
Why did you come so early?

162
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:41,734
I can't fail again this time.

163
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:45,371
So you came early to study?

164
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,308
- Yes.
- That's a big deal...

165
00:11:49,304 --> 00:11:52,011
Then I'll look forward to this exam.

166
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:53,845
Fighting!

167
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:56,482
Fighting!

168
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,441
I'm going.

169
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,700
What is this smell?

170
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:53,339
Teacher.

171
00:12:54,122 --> 00:12:55,174
Are you okay?

172
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:56,342
Teacher...

173
00:13:10,978 --> 00:13:13,126
You still have to do the exam.

174
00:13:21,027 --> 00:13:22,535
Excuse me.

175
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,637
Who are you?

176
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:29,609
Is there a student named Na Yi-soo?

177
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:44,023
It's not a big deal. We only
want to ask you something.

178
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:46,492
Yes. Please.

179
00:13:47,223 --> 00:13:49,629
I heard you don't have a good
relationship with Teacher Yoo?

180
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,432
Something unpleasant
happened recently.

181
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,734
- That time...
- Unpleasant?

182
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,105
The fact is Teacher Yoo gave
sleeping pills to a certain student.

183
00:14:00,415 --> 00:14:01,941
I don't know why he did that.

184
00:14:02,817 --> 00:14:06,179
Do you have a proof
to back up that statement?

185
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:08,147
Yes.

186
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,917
Yes, if you look
at the CCTV footage...

187
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,453
...you can see Teacher Yoo
is holding something...

188
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,723
...and switch it with one
of the student's belongings.

189
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,139
This is...

190
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,741
Why...

191
00:14:35,422 --> 00:14:38,144
Your name mentioned
in Teacher Yoo's death note.

192
00:14:38,507 --> 00:14:39,412
What?

193
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,583
He said he was very distressed
with what happened to that student.

194
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:50,256
He felt like all the career that
he had built up was falling apart.

195
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,191
I didn't accuse him.

196
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:54,961
This is the fact.

197
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:58,251
I saw him on the CCTV footage...

198
00:15:13,386 --> 00:15:16,249
I heard Teacher Yoo died
because of him?

199
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,118
There's a rumour about
what he did at his old school.

200
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,753
He was expelled.

201
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:23,758
Na Yi-soo.

202
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:26,058
Don't do it.

203
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,028
You won't change anything
by being angry.

204
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:31,597
So I have to take it like an idiot?

205
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:35,768
I just told the truth, but they said
Teacher Yoo died because of my lies.

206
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:38,271
That's not what it's all about.

207
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:41,675
Everyone is still confused
because it happened suddenly.

208
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,276
I forgot about it for a while.

209
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,449
That I have no one on my side.

210
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:53,553
Why are you being like that?
We're all on your side.

211
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:57,190
This problem can be solved
if I just disappear.

212
00:16:18,597 --> 00:16:20,613
I know this is so surprising...

213
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,683
...but does that mean
everyone has to starve?

214
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:27,453
No.

215
00:16:31,613 --> 00:16:34,627
They said Yi-soo once hit
Teacher Yoo on the rooftop.

216
00:16:36,936 --> 00:16:37,997
No way...

217
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:42,568
Everyone knew he was called to
the principal's office over that issue.

218
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:44,675
And...

219
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,809
...he got expelled for bullying kids
at his previous school.

220
00:16:50,353 --> 00:16:52,659
It's a very famous
incident at that school.

221
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:57,049
It's so different from Yi-soo I knew.

222
00:16:58,493 --> 00:16:59,952
It's a bit scary...

223
00:17:00,258 --> 00:17:04,590
Maybe there is another side of him
that we don't know?

224
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:10,229
If that's true, I think
I'll be little disappointed.

225
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,608
Damn!

226
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:58,344
Boss told us to take him alive.

227
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:00,755
Just give him enough punches.

228
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:03,467
Hey!

229
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:05,653
Hey!

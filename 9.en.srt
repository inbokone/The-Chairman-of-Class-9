00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:01,963
THE CHAIRMAN IS LEVEL 9

7
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,975
PLACES, CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

8
00:01:24,526 --> 00:01:25,586
Are you awake?

9
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,388
Are you okay?

10
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,261
What happened?

11
00:01:35,058 --> 00:01:36,530
You called me.

12
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,332
Hello.

13
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,767
- Ba-tang...
- Na Yi-soo?

14
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:42,903
- Ba-tang...
- Hey, Yi-soo!

15
00:02:04,995 --> 00:02:05,995
Really...

16
00:02:08,717 --> 00:02:11,798
Really, this is bad. So bad.

17
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,869
Who on earth made this
handsome face look like this?

18
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:22,309
If I catch them, those bastards
wouldn't be in this world anymore.

19
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:27,234
If I fought properly,
they would have been killed.

20
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:28,815
Oh my God!

21
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:31,852
If you go fighting,
your condition will get worse!

22
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:34,488
I am the one who get hit.

23
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:40,661
You don't have much fear
towards today's world.

24
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:42,529
Madam.

25
00:02:43,214 --> 00:02:45,632
You will take care of him
for the time being.

26
00:02:45,971 --> 00:02:47,100
Yes.

27
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:50,404
No, I can go to a hotel...

28
00:02:50,749 --> 00:02:51,905
Oh my!

29
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:53,907
How much is a hotel per night?

30
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:56,410
Students don't have money,
why you live there?

31
00:02:57,077 --> 00:03:01,673
That's right. Do it because
it may be dangerous for a while.

32
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:05,318
Don't feel bad.

33
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:07,855
Make yourself at home.

34
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,859
You should change into
comfortable clothes.

35
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,283
Go ahead.

36
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:18,131
Oh my God.

37
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:36,416
I've never raised a son in my life...

38
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:39,178
It's good.

39
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:50,560
Mom.

40
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:51,925
Isn't it mine?

41
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:54,293
It's cute.

42
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:02,843
Hey.

43
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:06,179
I really can stay at a hotel.

44
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,381
You should feel honoured.

45
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,440
This is the first XY chromosome
to stay in our house...

46
00:04:11,473 --> 00:04:13,820
...in Geumnam-gu for nearly 20 years.

47
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:17,887
Should I be happy?

48
00:04:19,404 --> 00:04:21,061
Do you snore by any chance?

49
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:23,897
That is... Why?

50
00:04:24,809 --> 00:04:28,001
If you have snoring issues,
I won't be able to get a good sleep.

51
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,245
My house is not soundproofed.

52
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:34,741
Is that so?

53
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:38,478
Do you think we are gonna
sleep next to each other?

54
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:39,946
Hey!

55
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,925
I said you didn't need to do that...

56
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,384
You brought me here!

57
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,267
Then what should I do?

58
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,457
What if someone else does this to you?
What should I do...

59
00:05:06,197 --> 00:05:07,174
Are you sleeping?

60
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,651
Not yet.

61
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:22,589
Thank you for today.

62
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:29,663
There was not a single day of silence
ever since you came...

63
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:32,729
You're right.

64
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:36,102
It's all because of me...

65
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:42,709
However, if something like this happens,
please call me first.

66
00:05:45,284 --> 00:05:47,080
You have seen my kicks, right?

67
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:53,787
If it was me, I would have escaped
with a back kick right away.

68
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:58,892
It's really because you
didn't see the situation.

69
00:05:59,732 --> 00:06:01,428
You wouldn't be able to handle it.

70
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:04,998
You just make excuses.

71
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:08,507
Hey! It's not like that!

72
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,440
I turned off the lamp and suddenly
several people rushed in.

73
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,476
What could I do in that situation?

74
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:26,453
Are you sleeping?

75
00:06:52,682 --> 00:06:53,813
Please.

76
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:58,889
- Son, eat a lot.
- Thank you for the food.

77
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,927
- It's so delicious.
- Glad to hear that.

78
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:10,263
What is that?

79
00:07:10,418 --> 00:07:12,901
You usually make
egg rice in the morning.

80
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:14,668
Oh my God, this kid.

81
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:17,938
We have a new family member,
egg rice wouldn't do.

82
00:07:18,913 --> 00:07:20,575
I like egg rice, too.

83
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,543
Do you usually eat breakfast
before going to school?

84
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,308
No.

85
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:27,361
I was trying to sleep
for one more minute...

86
00:07:27,394 --> 00:07:29,909
but surprisingly,
I slept so well here last night.

87
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:33,444
Really? That's a good thing.

88
00:07:33,477 --> 00:07:36,038
It's a bit of mess,
I had to clean it up in a hurry.

89
00:07:36,071 --> 00:07:37,757
I will clean up a little more today.

90
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:41,695
You don't have to worry
because it's okay right now.

91
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:43,929
Let's eat.

92
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,218
Is it good? You eat a lot.

93
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,057
What are you looking?

94
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:14,260
Are you excited because
a student come to school?

95
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:16,896
This bastard...

96
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:19,540
I thought you would never come back.

97
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,968
There are exams I have to attend.

98
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:49,527
Hey, Na Yi-soo.

99
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:51,898
What?

100
00:08:52,189 --> 00:08:54,401
Why did you just go away like that?

101
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:56,669
Do you know how worried we were?

102
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:01,007
I thought you'd never come again.

103
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:05,812
What did you say?
I don't eat bread!

104
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:09,240
No one thinks it's you.

105
00:09:10,754 --> 00:09:12,685
So, don't leave us again.

106
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:18,958
Just go to your seat.

107
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:11,678
Why?

108
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:13,713
Am I failed again?

109
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:16,228
Na Yi-soo...

110
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,085
You don't have to...

111
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,325
...take a remedial class!

112
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:27,997
I'm not failed!

113
00:10:29,852 --> 00:10:32,765
Na Yi-soo, anyone would think
you are the number one.

114
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,001
Han Ba-tang.

115
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:38,371
Congratulations.
You're number one again.

116
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:41,621
Thank you.

117
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,419
Congratulations.

118
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:55,822
And thank you.

119
00:10:57,305 --> 00:11:01,828
If you hadn't believed in me,
I probably would have given up.

120
00:11:03,332 --> 00:11:07,333
Thank you for not
letting me feel down.

121
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:23,383
I thought I was the only one
who was in a bad mood...

122
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,951
...but there's another one here.

123
00:11:36,672 --> 00:11:39,966
If I had known this would happen,
I would have studied abroad.

124
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,736
But who knew Balhae High
would turn out like this?

125
00:11:45,107 --> 00:11:48,614
Lately, there has never been
a quiet day.

126
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:51,744
It's all screwed.

127
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,013
There's no point to stay in Korea.

128
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,815
Even if you regret it now,
nothing will change.

129
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,119
It's because of you.

130
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:02,855
Me?

131
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,992
When I heard that you were going
to stay in Korea, I made up my mind.

132
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:09,638
But, what is this?

133
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,238
Don't you regret it?

134
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:25,178
I never regret it.

135
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,582
Na Yi-soo.
Are you just going to watch?

136
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:32,652
What's wrong with him?

137
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,856
School has been strange since he came.

138
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,581
But only the student president
who's on his side.

139
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,896
Shouldn’t you do something, too?

140
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,834
I didn't know you are
so concerned about school.

141
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:51,838
Are you really concerned
about school...

142
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,941
...or you just want to get rid of
the kids who annoy you?

143
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:01,594
I'm worried about you.

144
00:13:03,397 --> 00:13:05,885
They have nothing to lose anyway.

145
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:09,289
But we lose the most
if the school gets ruined like this.

146
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:13,359
I'll take care of that..

147
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,757
Hey, I'm really okay.

148
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,872
Are you scared because
you were drunk yesterday?

149
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,444
I feel bad because
you always buy it for me.

150
00:13:28,477 --> 00:13:30,777
I can use my dad’s card,
so don't worry.

151
00:13:31,892 --> 00:13:33,780
You guys seem to keep
forgetting who I am.

152
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:36,716
We know it.
We know it well.

153
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:38,018
Okay.

154
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,353
We're here.

155
00:13:53,196 --> 00:13:55,635
Why did you come here again?

156
00:13:56,221 --> 00:13:57,221
Why?

157
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:01,240
- You don't know?
- I don't know, so I ask you.

158
00:14:08,885 --> 00:14:10,083
You ordered them, did you?

159
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:13,386
What are you saying?

160
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:16,723
Those thugs who came to my house...

161
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,859
I've seen them somewhere.

162
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,429
I really don't know!

163
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:24,597
You don't know?

164
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:28,868
They're the thugs hired by your dad
and you don't know?

165
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,981
Hey, son.

166
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:41,314
A boy may get scratches
on his face once or twice...

167
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:47,053
...but if it keeps happen,
something is not right here.

168
00:14:48,994 --> 00:14:50,523
Right?

169
00:14:51,732 --> 00:14:54,327
- That's right.
- Really?

170
00:14:56,129 --> 00:15:00,733
You embarrass the Great Pi Deok-jin!
I can't go anywhere because of you!

171
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:08,407
PRESIDENT NA

172
00:15:14,426 --> 00:15:15,715
Oh, President.

173
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:18,507
Why are you calling me at this hour?

174
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:22,636
Yes?

175
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,528
You will get trouble if you do
such a thing these days.

176
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,798
Nowadays CCTV has a black box,
there are a lot of eyes watching.

177
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:33,833
So kidnapping is a past thing.

178
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:40,139
If you're willing to pay that much,
it's a different story.

179
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,260
Don't worry, we will execute it.

180
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,319
Yes.

181
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:51,763
Gather everyone.

182
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,791
- We will work overtime.
- Yes, Boss.

183
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,113
I think he got a call from him
after your dad passed away.

184
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,399
I heard that the new chairman
suggested to work together...

185
00:16:08,893 --> 00:16:11,904
The new chairman...
Is he my uncle?

186
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,482
That's all I know.
I know nothing else.

187
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:24,905
Na Yi-soo.

188
00:16:31,454 --> 00:16:34,723
Are you happy at your new school?

189
00:16:36,632 --> 00:16:38,612
You must be glad I'm gone.

190
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:42,125
How long do you want
to live like this?

191
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,339
That uniform...

192
00:16:47,983 --> 00:16:49,242
It suits you well.

193
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,680
How long do I have to live like this?

194
00:17:20,076 --> 00:17:23,142
If his dad is a gangster,
is he also a gangster?

195
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,480
He feels strong and powerful...

196
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:28,084
...after Na Yi-soo who always
beat him has gone.

197
00:17:28,117 --> 00:17:29,615
What a coward.

198
00:17:29,793 --> 00:17:32,752
We better shut up
and do what he wants.

199
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,373
If it wasn't for him,
we wouldn't be able to drink for free.

200
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:38,224
We just have to pretend
to be his friend. How difficult is it?

201
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:39,408
You don't like it?

202
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:42,293
- It's really easy.
- Yeah, don't worry.

203
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:51,103
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

204
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:54,707
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

205
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,178
♪ Our beloved Na Yi-soo ♪

206
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:02,114
What are you doing?
Make a wish and blow out the candles.

207
00:18:14,712 --> 00:18:16,077
Happy birthday.

208
00:18:17,092 --> 00:18:19,332
Looks like everyone is busy today.

209
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:22,201
Yes, you know that everyone is busy.

210
00:18:24,138 --> 00:18:25,258
How about Mom?

211
00:18:26,207 --> 00:18:30,028
Your mother is attending an event...

212
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:32,712
...held at Balhae High
on behalf of your father.

213
00:18:33,884 --> 00:18:35,648
It's time to get used to it.

214
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:39,218
A birthday to spend
with our Attorney Hwang.

215
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:44,165
Did you make a good wish?

216
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,058
Yes.

217
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:48,469
Can I ask what your wish is?

218
00:18:50,906 --> 00:18:55,377
Next year, I hope they won't be too busy,
so we can celebrate my birthday together.

219
00:18:56,812 --> 00:19:00,059
That wish will definitely come true.

220
00:19:11,296 --> 00:19:12,447
Why did you do that?

221
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:18,157
If you hadn't sent her to Balhae High
in the first place...

222
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:19,925
...none of this wouldn't happen.

223
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,534
Yi-soo.

224
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:26,232
And there are too many things that don't
make sense to say it was just an accident!

225
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:29,669
A car that was in good condition,
suddenly had brake failure?

226
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:32,477
It's all over. Just stop it.

227
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:34,975
It's all over?

228
00:19:37,246 --> 00:19:41,180
You made mom like that...

229
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,912
I should have died.

230
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,453
I'm sorry I couldn't do that.

231
00:19:47,593 --> 00:19:49,088
Is that comforting?

232
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:53,325
I'm sorry.

233
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:57,630
There's no need to say sorry,
I just wish everything would go to waste!

234
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:24,690
What, are you crying?

235
00:20:26,304 --> 00:20:27,593
What did you say?

236
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:30,529
It's because I have rhinitis.

237
00:20:31,192 --> 00:20:32,665
Well then.

238
00:20:32,887 --> 00:20:34,900
I think you were so moved and cried.

239
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:38,437
I think I forgot...

240
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,372
...that today is my birthday.

241
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,910
Don't worry for the next.

242
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,681
I'll take care of you all the time,
so you won't forget anything, right?

243
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:51,088
Actually...

244
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,853
...today is the day my mom died.

245
00:20:55,926 --> 00:21:00,292
Sorry. I didn't know about it.

246
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:06,832
So, I always pass my birthday quietly.

247
00:21:07,703 --> 00:21:08,768
But...

248
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:14,774
It's nice to make a wish in front of
a cake like this after a long time.

249
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:22,181
Can I ask what you wished for?

250
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,250
It's a secret...

251
00:21:25,444 --> 00:21:26,484
Why is that?

252
00:21:28,734 --> 00:21:32,925
In fact, whenever I make a wish,
it always comes true in the opposite way.

253
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:35,294
So, what is that?

254
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:39,586
He's so boring...

255
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:53,212
I wish it's all being a mess.

256
00:21:54,258 --> 00:21:56,715
The friends who gathered
to pursue their dreams...

257
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,118
...and Balhae High School,
which embraces them.

258
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,620
I wish everything would be ruined.

259
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:05,995
I prayed and prayed for my cursed wish.

260
00:22:07,014 --> 00:22:10,099
I hope everyone is happy...

261
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,700
With this, we pass the motion
to impeach the chairman of the board...

262
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:19,305
...from Balhae High School,
and the Big Picture Corporation.

00:00:00,242 --> 00:00:02,992
IF YOU RUN AWAY, YOU DIE

2
00:00:13,704 --> 00:00:16,390
Breathe in and breathe out.

3
00:00:16,423 --> 00:00:18,780
It's not that hard.

4
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:20,952
Please save me.

5
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:24,058
If anyone see this, they would think
I'm threatening you.

6
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:28,710
Isn't this gentle enough to treat people
who don't want to pay their debt?

7
00:00:28,743 --> 00:00:30,116
Is that right?

8
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:31,999
Yes!

9
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,032
Oh my gosh.

10
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:41,909
Is it okay to criticize someone
who tells you to live a good life?

11
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:50,244
My son! Are you here?

12
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:21,027
The brat who did this to you...
Where is he?

13
00:01:24,754 --> 00:01:26,720

You are so impatient.

21
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:10,330
You can talk after I finish this song.

22
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:14,802
Because I can't stand it,
after I saw a lot of blood.

23
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,199
So, what do you want to say?

24
00:02:18,746 --> 00:02:21,417
If you ask what is
my education motto...

25
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,393
First, let's not hit and get hit.

26
00:02:24,426 --> 00:02:29,850
Second, if that thing happened
let's pay it back two or three times.

27
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,075
And third!

28
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:34,468
Don't worry about the price.

29
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:37,279
Are you Oh Eun-young?

30
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:39,579
Your golden son attacked me first.

31
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:45,832
No, this brat open his eyes like crazy.

32
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,098
Hey, my son!

33
00:02:48,215 --> 00:02:50,015
Just checked the fact only.

34
00:02:52,153 --> 00:02:53,354
Yes.

35
00:02:53,387 --> 00:02:54,902
I attacked him first.

36
00:02:58,403 --> 00:03:02,613
You attacked him first,
but this brat don't have any scratch?

37
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,815
Pi Deok-jin's son!

38
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:10,736
What kind of shit is this?

39
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,027
It's over, right?

40
00:03:12,035 --> 00:03:14,035
I'm busy, so I need to go now.

41
00:03:15,652 --> 00:03:16,652
Hey!

42
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:19,191
Sit.

43
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:23,878
There's one song left,
so why don't you just pick one?

44
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,676
Is there any way to not listening?

45
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:32,526
Hey, please tell me
what the right life is.

46
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:34,722
Classically.

47
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,995
Hey, kid.

48
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,417
These guys.

49
00:03:59,628 --> 00:04:00,854
This!

50
00:04:27,748 --> 00:04:29,428

55
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:55,446

00:04:58,444 --> 00:05:01,437
<i>Places, characters, institutions</i>
<i>and events in this drama are fictitious.</i>

57
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:12,078
Hey, taking pictures alone is not fun.
Let's take a picture together!

58
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,814
Hey!

59
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:18,518
Do you know how good is
your phone's picture quality?

60
00:05:19,097 --> 00:05:21,079
But what kind of picture you want to take?

61
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,924
This is why I can’t say
anything to the T's.

62
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:26,274
The emotion is different.

63
00:05:26,323 --> 00:05:29,262
I need to work hard to leave it behind
when I was young and pretty.

64
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:39,105
What kind of ID photo you take?

65
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:41,584
Relax your expression a little,
be comfortable.

66
00:05:54,661 --> 00:05:57,624
Ba-tang, you look good on this.
Change your profile picture to this.

67
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,860
What? What's wrong
with my profile picture?

68
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,263
People would think
it's your mom’s photo.

69
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,931
Why do you take picture of the flowers
blooming on road side?

70
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,537
It's admirable.
Flowers blooming relentlessly.

71
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,920
She only picks word that makes me mad.

72
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:15,421
It seems like you still live without
knowing the true joys of the world.

73
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:18,912
Today, I will show you properly.

74
00:06:19,953 --> 00:06:22,866
Hey, I need to go home
and do my homework!

75
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:32,856
I tried to learn properly,
but you are too bland.

76
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:41,601
Even in these days of peace,
there is fist like this.

77
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,103
Okay.

78
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:47,708
I feel like looking back at younger days
when I was called Mudeungsan Son Deok-gi.

79
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,679
Right? How about become our family?

80
00:06:53,136 --> 00:06:55,862
I will give you a lot of money.

81
00:06:57,447 --> 00:06:59,152
I have a lot of money, too.

82
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:03,423
Instead of me, you should take care
of your family members.

83
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,626
Everyone struggles
to survive at an age...

84
00:07:06,972 --> 00:07:08,768
...when their bones
can't even stick well.

85
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:13,081
Hey, you.

86
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:19,690
Come to me if you run out
of pocket money.

87
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:48,673
Is this the joy of the world
that you said?

88
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:20,058
Yes.

89
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:23,803
I'm Na Yi-soo.

90
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,869
BP BIG PICTURE

91
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:06,339
Long time no see.

92
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:08,315
How are you?

93
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:12,207
Isn’t it better if we don’t see each
other often, Attorney Hwang?

94
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:16,197
The last time you saw me
was a year ago, right?

95
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,408
It's supposed to be a good thing,
but it's always like this.

96
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:24,347
And so, how bad is the news
that you're taking such a long time?

97
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:28,947
Not long ago, Chairman had an accident.

98
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,238
With some surgeries,
he was getting better,...

99
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:34,741
...but in the end, he passed away.

100
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:43,616
Chairman said he wanted to end his life
quietly and without ceremony.

101
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,513
The funeral arrangements
were not announced to anyone.

102
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,458
He act cool until the end.

103
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,627
Don't you know the best
about Chairman's personality?

104
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,531
I'm sick of this
one-sided information.

105
00:09:59,968 --> 00:10:03,303
But I didn't know it would turn out
like this until I went there.

106
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,205
If it turns out like this,...

107
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,959
...just keep it a secret whether he's
dead or alive for the rest of his life.

108
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,351
I know that you must be upset.

109
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:12,245
No.

110
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:14,481
I'm not upset at all.

111
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,485
I wondered when this day will come.

112
00:10:18,814 --> 00:10:21,721
However, he missed you a lot
before he passed away.

113
00:10:22,337 --> 00:10:23,590
He missed me?

114
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:25,757
Me?

115
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,928
Attorney Hwang.

116
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,540
Even if you make it cheesy, you have
to hit it in a more realistic way.

117
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:35,473
Do you still don't know that person?

118
00:10:36,489 --> 00:10:40,974
For his life, he is a person
who lived as if I didn't exist.

119
00:10:45,234 --> 00:10:47,799
If you have nothing else to say,
I will go now.

120
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:48,948
Wait a moment.

121
00:10:52,124 --> 00:10:53,386
Here is the main point.

122
00:10:56,382 --> 00:10:59,145
- What is this?
- As you can see.

123
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:06,253
THE WILL

124
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:08,766
Maybe...

125
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,306
Is there any hidden
Chinese girl friend?

126
00:11:14,118 --> 00:11:15,375
It's a will.

127
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:25,351
A person who didn't do
KakaoTalk in his life.

128
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:27,487
What did he have to say to me?

129
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,323
I just do my job.

130
00:11:38,846 --> 00:11:41,734
The job that you do...
Just do it, then.

131
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,609
"The will."

132
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:52,212
Yi-soo.

133
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:56,677
"As I'm facing my death,
the things that I can leave you..."

134
00:11:56,702 --> 00:11:58,068
Wait.

135
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:01,488
I don't know about it at all.

136
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,590
So, what is the conclusion?

137
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,591
"Balhae High School."

138
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,361
"I will leave it to you."

139
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:11,864
No, if it's Balhae High School...

140
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:13,566
As per will of Chairman Na-seong,...

141
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,976
...it's the most prestigious
private school in Korea.

142
00:12:16,025 --> 00:12:20,573
Many of its graduates go to famous
universities abroad and SKY every year.

143
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,092
From culture, science,
art and physical education,...

144
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:26,479
...our Balhae High School
shines in various fields!

145
00:12:26,984 --> 00:12:27,880
Wait.

146
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,183
"Our Balhae High School?"

147
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,019
I am a 12th batch graduate
of Balhae High School.

148
00:12:38,377 --> 00:12:39,838
No, why is school?

149
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,597
I don't want it, please change it
to another thing.

150
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:47,000
There are many good things.

151
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:49,335
Hotel, entertainment agency.

152
00:12:50,511 --> 00:12:52,829
If that's not possible,
just give me cash.

153
00:12:52,878 --> 00:12:55,208
No, it's not an online shopping mall.

154
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,143
You can't change it or get refund.

155
00:12:58,104 --> 00:12:59,378
As for me...

156
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:03,249
I get very embarrassed
when I think of school.

157
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,453
But now you're asking me
to operate a school?

158
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,856
I can't.

159
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:11,791
No, I won't do it.

160
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,863
Don't you know how much
Chairman care for this school?

161
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:17,563
That's why I hate it more!

162
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:21,901
Anyway, I don't need this.

163
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,103
You just take care of the rest.

164
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:31,885
Wait.

165
00:13:34,017 --> 00:13:35,548
If I become the chairman,...

166
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:38,751
...am I free to do whatever
I want at school?

167
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:40,553
As you want...

168
00:13:42,228 --> 00:13:44,094
Basically, yes.

169
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:47,860
But one condition is required
to officially own Balhae High School.

170
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,479
What is that?

171
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:57,735
<i>Article 1, Verse 12. The position of</i>
<i>chairman of Balhae School Corporation,...</i>

172
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,206
<i>...is limited to those who graduated</i>
<i>from Balhae High School.</i>

173
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,041
Old geezer.

174
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,878
You criticized my academic background.

175
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:10,083
I guess you expected me to live obediently
and bring glory to your name.

176
00:14:10,602 --> 00:14:12,344
The school you loved...

177
00:14:14,118 --> 00:14:16,222
I will make it a mess.

178
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,998
Miss Baek, did you hear that?

179
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,167
There is a new chairman coming.

180
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:29,869
I know it.

181
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:33,777
It's an opportunity, you know?

182
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:36,676
Who knows if the new chairman
will take a full-time teacher?

183
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:40,113
I don't have much time left
in my contract.

184
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:43,116
What will change
if a new chairman comes?

185
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,219
This is the problem with
the MZ generation these days.

186
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:50,890
In this time, you have to do your best
to grab any opportunity!

187
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:55,361
Hey, in these times, would you be
able to be a full-time teacher?

188
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:56,901
That's right.

189
00:14:56,934 --> 00:15:00,933
If I work hard like you, maybe
l can be a full-time teacher.

190
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:04,570
By the way what kind of person
the new chairman is?

191
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:05,872
That's the thing.

192
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:10,676
I don't know. Nobody knows.

193
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:14,414
We only know we have a new chairman,
his identity is still hidden.

194
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:17,483
The principal has definitely
become more sensitive these days.

195
00:15:18,382 --> 00:15:22,655
Anyway, I think it would be best
to take care of yourself for some time.

196
00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:27,264
I really wish he is like
the former chairman.

197
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:30,029
We don't know if there will be
another person like him.

198
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:34,321
Who are you?

199
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:37,570
I just moved...

200
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:39,313
Chairman?

201
00:15:41,664 --> 00:15:43,764
I just moved...

202
00:15:43,797 --> 00:15:45,745
I'm a transfer student.

203
00:15:46,617 --> 00:15:48,881
You startled me.
Why did you make such a fuss?

204
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:52,018
It's amazing.

205
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:55,121
Our school is not that easy
to accept transfer students.

206
00:15:55,985 --> 00:15:58,224
Looks like you did good
at your previous school.

207
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:00,293
Yes...

208
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:02,962
Something happened.

209
00:16:03,298 --> 00:16:05,698
Still, you better be a little nervous.

210
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:10,770
Our class is a bit unusual
even by this school's standard.

211
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,179
We have a new student here.

212
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,082
He said his old school
is quite reputable.

213
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:29,088
Let's help him
spread his wings further!

214
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:30,607
Yes.

215
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,656
Say hi!

216
00:16:35,918 --> 00:16:37,830
<i>Attack victory.</i>

217
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,767
<i>If you make a good first impression,</i>
<i>no one will mess with you.</i>

218
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,512
I'm Na Yi-soo.

219
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,075
I don't know the way to lose.

220
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:52,178
I'm planning to rule
Balhae High School from today,

221
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,312
Any objection?

222
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:00,717
Wow! Oh my God!

223
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:02,321
Your spirit is crazy!

224
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,647
Welcome.

225
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,595
<i>What are these guys?</i>
<i>Are they being sarcastic?</i>

226
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:14,742
I think Yi-soo better sit
beside Ba-tang.

227
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,936
Ba-tang, you can take care
of Yi-soo, right?

228
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:17,917
Yes!

229
00:17:18,243 --> 00:17:19,839
Of course, I believe you, Ba-tang.

230
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:21,641
Okay.

231
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,610
So, shall we start the day
by shouting our slogans?

232
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:25,878
Yes!

233
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:31,116
We wish victory! We want 100 points!
We wish the best! We wish first place!

234
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:34,587
Balhae! Go! Yes!

235
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,705
- Keep your spirit, everyone!
- Yes.

236
00:17:54,964 --> 00:17:57,979
<i>What is this?</i>
<i>She looks boring...</i>

237
00:17:59,947 --> 00:18:02,148
What? Do you have any question?

238
00:18:04,394 --> 00:18:07,520
- Who is the most popular here?
- What?

239
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:10,890
You make me say it twice.

240
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,460
I asked, who is the most popular here?

241
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:17,396
What are you talking?
You're so childish.

242
00:18:18,238 --> 00:18:20,034
We don't care about that here.

243
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:27,106
<i>Physically, that guy</i>
<i>looks the best here.</i>

244
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:30,810
<i>Did he smile?</i>

245
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:34,213
That guy. Is he the one?

246
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:39,352
Hey, Boo Ro-woon!

247
00:18:39,838 --> 00:18:41,087
Are you good at fight?

248
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:42,888
Fight?

249
00:18:43,604 --> 00:18:46,592
I never been into a fight
since I was born.

250
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:48,427
Why are you asking?

251
00:18:50,331 --> 00:18:51,831
The transfer student asked it.

252
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:54,275
Really?

253
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:58,588
You are an introvert, are you?

254
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,341
You can ask me directly about it.

255
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:12,351
Transfer student, you want to eat bread?

256
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:17,056
<i>As expected, just by appearing, the bread</i>
<i>shuttle starts to stick to itself.</i>

257
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,891
You don't like cream bread?

258
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,661
Then should I go to the store
and buy something else?

259
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:24,397
Our school is a heaven
for bread lovers.

260
00:19:25,025 --> 00:19:26,832
I'm a bit of a picky eater.

261
00:19:26,971 --> 00:19:28,634
A quiz?

262
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:32,005
Then I'll try to guess
what your taste is.

263
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,140
It's good to become friends like this

264
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:40,212
Our school’s pizza bread
is really delicious.

265
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:43,616
How is it? At this level,
do I pass as a friend?

266
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,317
A friend for one bread?

267
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:46,651
Huh?

268
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,747
It's not just a bread.

269
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,858
This is something precious you can eat
at the school cafeteria.

270
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:56,128
- Are you testing my patience?
- Try it!

271
00:19:56,163 --> 00:19:57,997
Damn, I won't eat it!

272
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:03,736
What are you doing?

273
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:07,440
I don't want to eat it but he keeps...

274
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,498
Ho-kyu, are you okay?

275
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,613
He wants to be your friend.

276
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,815
How could you hurt
his feelings like that?

277
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:19,852
Hurt his feelings? He forced me
to eat that damn bread!

278
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:21,954
Damn bread?

279
00:20:22,318 --> 00:20:23,923
It's the only one left...

280
00:20:24,543 --> 00:20:25,758
This bread is precious.

281
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,461
Apologize.

282
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:30,062
What?

283
00:20:30,653 --> 00:20:33,499
While I'm being nice to you,
apologize.

284
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:36,368
Who are you?

285
00:20:37,254 --> 00:20:39,271
The best that you've been looking for.

286
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:41,981
What?

287
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:45,244
You said you don't know
the way to lose, right?

288
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,546
Can you avoid losing from me?

289
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,240
Follow me to the rooftop.

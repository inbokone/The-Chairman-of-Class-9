1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,154
Where on earth are we going?

2
00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:06,740
It's exam period and you're always
playing games?

3
00:00:08,453 --> 00:00:09,529
How do you know?

4
00:00:09,562 --> 00:00:12,296
I searched the records.
ID Ajunayisoo.

5
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,850
It is wrong to say
that students should only study.

6
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:19,834
So, you suddenly created
a gaming class?

7
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:21,221
To follow the global trend?

8
00:00:22,641 --> 00:00:24,091
News spread fast.

9
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,194
Who told you? Principal?

10
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:28,861
Let's go.

11
00:00:29,922 --> 00:00:33,117
Where are we going?
I have to take a placement test.

12
00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:40,842
What is this? Why are we here?

13
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:44,006
- You will know once you're in.
- I'm not going.

14
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:04,130
MOON SUNG-HYUN

15
00:01:06,702 --> 00:01:08,136
KIM SHI-KYUNG

16
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:10,807
HYUN-SUK

17
00:01:12,243 --> 00:01:15,644
HWANG HYE-JIN, CHA JUN-HYUK,
CHOI JI-HYE, LEE HYO-BIN

18
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,981
KIM KYUNG-MIN, KI HYUN-WOO,
KIM WON-HOON, LEE CHANG-HO

19
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,159
THE CHAIRMAN IS LEVEL 9

20
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:36,163
PLACES, CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

21
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:43,870
Oh, my God.

22
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:47,456
- How are you?
- Hi, Ba-tang.

23
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:49,743
You came early today.

24
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:53,747
I have a friend that I want to
introduce to you today.

25
00:01:54,193 --> 00:01:55,549
Wait a moment.

26
00:01:56,091 --> 00:01:57,091
Come in!

27
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:09,229
What? Why are you coming
with Mister Hwang?

28
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,198
Mister Hwang?

29
00:02:11,976 --> 00:02:14,368
Is he your new friend
that I met the other day?

30
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:19,340
Ma'am, this friend is also planning
to take a lesson in the future...

31
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:22,363
- ...if that's okay with you.
- Of course.

32
00:02:22,396 --> 00:02:23,396
A lesson?

33
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,847
Please come on in.

34
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,182
This is good.

35
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,852
Hey, what is this?

36
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,720
What happened?

37
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:35,841
That's it.

38
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:38,258
What are you doing?
Let's start the lesson!

39
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:39,792
Yes!

40
00:02:42,435 --> 00:02:45,298
Why are you asking too much from me?

41
00:02:46,044 --> 00:02:49,469
Yi-soo. You must control
your temper when you study.

42
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:51,738
Attorney...

43
00:02:52,474 --> 00:02:53,474
Mister Hwang.

44
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:57,744
You didn't tell me
it would be like this.

45
00:02:59,404 --> 00:03:01,448
Then shall we take
a break for a while?

46
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:02,983
Yes.

47
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:12,559
Hey, do you have a relation
with Mister Hwang?

48
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:14,861
That's something I want to ask you.

49
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:16,930
How do you know him?

50
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,801
He's like a noble person to me.

51
00:03:21,538 --> 00:03:22,502
Noble?

52
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:29,009
The late chairman knew about my situation
and introduced me to a volunteer teacher.

53
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,644
He was Attorney Hwang.

54
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:36,183
And again, thanks to Chairman.

55
00:03:37,696 --> 00:03:40,721
He's an amazing person.

56
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:48,562
ANYONE CAN SUCCEED

57
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:49,728
You read it!

58
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,565
He’s a person I really respected.

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,726
Thanks to him, a poor girl like me
can have a bright future...

60
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,038
...and receiving a good education
at a good school.

61
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,139
Respect?

62
00:03:59,992 --> 00:04:03,043
Do you just respect anyone
who treats you well?

63
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:04,511
What?

64
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:07,451
Don't trust people just because
they are kind to you.

65
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:10,349
Do you know how long this person
must have lived wearing a mask?

66
00:04:11,086 --> 00:04:12,476
Why are you angry?

67
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:14,347
If you don’t want to read it,
just say it!

68
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,338
Why are you so easy
to criticize other people?

69
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,068
What?

70
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,020
You always act strong,
but have you helped others?

71
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:37,070
Take a look at yourself
before judging anyone.

72
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,256
Otherwise, you will end up
living like that.

73
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:43,884
Gossiping about others behind their backs,
without achieving anything in your life.

74
00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:06,139
Hey.

75
00:05:06,465 --> 00:05:07,541
Have you heard?

76
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,345
There's a rumor that the new chairman
of our school is very handsome.

77
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,049
No one knows who he is.
How do they know he's handsome?

78
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:19,853
Someone anonymously posted this
on behalf of Balhae High School.

79
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:23,089
No way!

80
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,258
Didn't the chairman posted it himself?

81
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,993
There's no way.

82
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:30,400
The new chairman
is a man in his 40s or 50s.

83
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:33,033
Those guys don't know
social media exist.

84
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:43,314
BALHAE HIGH GROUP.
WHO IS OUR NEW CHAIRMAN?

85
00:05:43,348 --> 00:05:45,204
I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT SEEMS HE'S CRAZY.

86
00:05:45,237 --> 00:05:48,048
HE HAS LOW SELF ESTEEM,
THAT'S WHY HE DOESN'T SHOW HIMSELF.

87
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,081
Crap!

88
00:05:51,103 --> 00:05:56,489
The new chairman is so handsome.
I saw him myself.

89
00:06:12,392 --> 00:06:14,822
Why are you here?
There are many other seats.

90
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,410
You said this yourself.

91
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,947
Take a look at yourself
before you judging anyone.

92
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:25,553
That's why I'm going to try something.

93
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:30,563
They say you won't be able
to graduate if you fail the exam.

94
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,577
Sit somewhere else!

95
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,321
How can you do this everyday?

96
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:56,059
This is the first time someone ask me that
since I attended Balhae High School.

97
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,521
Everyone here is studying,
not just me.

98
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,427
I have read this many times,
but I still don't get it.

99
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:14,070
It would be faster to just give up.

100
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:23,176
If you don't know this, you have
to determine the unknown first.

101
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:27,580
It means you don't know the value.

102
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:32,252
The value can be different,
depending on how you substitute it.

103
00:07:33,604 --> 00:07:37,090
The things I don't know,
sounds like me.

104
00:07:38,654 --> 00:07:41,127
Unknown, Na Yi-soo.

105
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:44,130
Even the names are similar.

106
00:07:44,886 --> 00:07:49,703
You're talking too much,
it seems you will fail your exam.

107
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:53,006
If you fail your exam,
you won't be graduated.

108
00:07:57,198 --> 00:07:59,759
If there's something you don't
understand, I'll explain it.

109
00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:00,847
Let's do it again.

110
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:03,409
I don't want to do it.

111
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:10,269
Can I ask you something?

112
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:14,861
I will refuse if you ask me
about these math problems.

113
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:18,365
That's not it.

114
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,334
How about Eun-bin?

115
00:08:23,793 --> 00:08:25,331
What? How?

116
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,276
It seems you guys are doing well.

117
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:33,380
What is that?

118
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:37,150
Why kind of question is that?
It's not even an unknown.

119
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:41,187
Was lunch from Eun-bin yummy?

120
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:42,789
Yeah, it's good.

121
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,966
I thought you were a nerd,
but you're good at basketball.

122
00:09:30,494 --> 00:09:33,606
Do you also think of me
as a boring guy who always smile?

123
00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:41,014
Why are you staring at me?

124
00:09:41,428 --> 00:09:42,482
Are you Kang Baek-ho?

125
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:46,319
Okay, then.
Let's play again next time.

126
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,360
Can I ask you something?

127
00:09:57,673 --> 00:09:58,631
What is that?

128
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,837
Do you like Ba-tang?

129
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:12,043
What?

130
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:16,549
It's just, you two always go together.

131
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,775
It's not like that.

132
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:23,423
If I failed my exam, he would feel
responsible as the class president.

133
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:25,325
- That's why...
- Is that all?

134
00:10:29,722 --> 00:10:31,397
Are you feeling jealous?

135
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:39,082
I am.

136
00:10:41,714 --> 00:10:43,042
Boo Ro-woon, this kid...

137
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:45,945
Hey, don't worry.

138
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:47,814
Me with Han Ba-tang?

139
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:50,984
I'm really living my life
and making excuses for everything.

140
00:10:53,705 --> 00:10:55,681
Let's go inside.
It's cold.

141
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,885
AFTER LESSON. #SELFIE

142
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:14,808
BA-TANG, YOU LOOK PRETTY
WITH THAT HAIR.

143
00:11:14,854 --> 00:11:18,278
Why don't you put this on a jumbotron
and tell her that you love her?

144
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,813
Na Yi-soo, what are you doing?

145
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:26,172
You're not a cat,
but I didn't hear your footsteps.

146
00:11:26,205 --> 00:11:28,688
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

147
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:33,026
Hey! Don't look at someone's
cellphone like that!

148
00:11:35,752 --> 00:11:37,797
What did you see
so you were jumpy like that?

149
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,033
No, it's just...

150
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,302
...various stories
from around the world.

151
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,572
Ba-tang is pretty.

152
00:11:46,217 --> 00:11:47,941
What do you say?

153
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:51,379
I just happened to see it
pop up in the algorithm,

154
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:54,372
It's just...
How can I explain this?

155
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:57,183
What do you mean?
Everyone likes Ba-tang.

156
00:11:59,748 --> 00:12:00,753
Yeah...

157
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,722
Everyone likes her, right?

158
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:06,059
They like Ba-tang.

159
00:12:09,576 --> 00:12:11,197
But don't like her too much.

160
00:12:13,018 --> 00:12:13,933
What?

161
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,672
Don't waste your emotions
and get hurt by someone.

162
00:12:35,642 --> 00:12:37,709
You got exactly 50 points.

163
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,361
If you continue like this,
you will definitely fail.

164
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,481
I can't do it.

165
00:12:45,173 --> 00:12:46,132
No.

166
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,568
Why am I so obsessed with this test?

167
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:54,274
They say if I fail
I won't be able to graduate!

168
00:12:56,158 --> 00:12:58,044
Are you filming a psycho drama
by yourself?

169
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:02,448
You're lucky. You have no worries.

170
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:05,285
I have my worries, too.

171
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:08,755
I also get really nervous
when the exam day comes.

172
00:13:10,906 --> 00:13:13,126
Can you give me tips for exam?

173
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,602
I always drink peppermint tea
that my mom made...

174
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,604
...to feel at ease
and do well on exams.

175
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:28,107
You have to drink peppermint tea
to be the number one student.

176
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
I'll write it down.

177
00:13:32,116 --> 00:13:33,146
Hey...

178
00:13:33,624 --> 00:13:35,815
That's not what it's all about.

179
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:37,749
What else?

180
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:40,019
What's the secret?

181
00:13:48,505 --> 00:13:51,264
I don't give this to anyone.

182
00:13:53,747 --> 00:13:56,135
It's just a cheap pen.

183
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,037
What do you mean by that?

184
00:13:58,816 --> 00:14:00,501
It may seem ordinary...

185
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:03,676
...but it's a cheap pen that gave me
perfect scores on mock exams.

186
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,279
Can you just give it to me?

187
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:09,749
What else can I do?
You said you want to be graduated.

188
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,221
But why you just want to be graduated
and not go to college?

189
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:18,191
Is there anything you want to do?

190
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:23,429
You right.

191
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:30,136
Sometimes, you are harder than
a four point math problem.

192
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:35,174
All my live, I've been looking
for the wrong answers...

193
00:14:35,951 --> 00:14:38,211
...and suddenly an unfamiliar
question appeared.

194
00:14:39,664 --> 00:14:42,615
Why should I look
for the right answer?

195
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:45,651
Don't forget.

196
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,556
I came here to change
all the correct answers from her...

197
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:54,293
...into the wrong answers.

198
00:15:10,898 --> 00:15:13,346
- Hello, Teacher.
- Hi.

199
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:14,945
Yi-soo.

200
00:15:16,187 --> 00:15:18,017
Hi, Teacher.

201
00:15:18,562 --> 00:15:20,920
Is the studying for the test going well?

202
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,890
A little bit.

203
00:15:24,812 --> 00:15:25,812
Great.

204
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:38,738
This one, too.

205
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:51,551
It's great, really.

206
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,391
BA-TANG'S SNACK BAR

207
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:59,489
Ba-tang, you left this!

208
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,565
Peppermint tea. You say you have
to drink this to do well on exams.

209
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:09,442
Drink it during break time to relax.

210
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:12,739
I'll do my best.

211
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,355
You don't have to be
the best all the time.

212
00:16:16,388 --> 00:16:19,973
Just do what you can, okay?

213
00:16:21,192 --> 00:16:22,982
- I will be back.
- Just go.

214
00:16:28,748 --> 00:16:30,276
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE

215
00:16:38,117 --> 00:16:39,198
Are you ready?

216
00:16:40,468 --> 00:16:41,468
Of course.

217
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:43,970
How about you?

218
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:48,341
Today, I want to get some energy
from number one student in this school.

219
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,146
Okay, are you ready for the test?

220
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:55,871
No.

221
00:16:55,904 --> 00:16:57,450
You must be ready.

222
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,355
If you study enough,
you will get more out of it.

223
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:03,589
Elevate your ability.
Be focus and be sure.

224
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:05,825
Here is the questions.

225
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:11,564
It's only a week,
but do it until the end.

226
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:23,709
Na Yi-soo suddenly moved
to Balhae High School...

227
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:28,147
...and came to his senses
after his father died?

228
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,468
It seems Na Yisoo is being considered
as the new chairman.

229
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,359
No. Does it make sense?

230
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,662
We can't let that incompetent kid
run Balhae High School.

231
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:52,071
That's why you must
control this situation.

232
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:04,225
Guys, be quiet.

233
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:06,652
Close your book and get ready
for the next test.

234
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:08,588
Go back to your seat!

235
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:12,313
Hurry, we don't have time!

236
00:18:29,411 --> 00:18:31,144
KOREAN TEST QUESTION SHEET

237
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,267
Ba-tang, what's wrong?

238
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,003
Are you okay? What happened?

239
00:18:57,171 --> 00:18:58,660
Hey, come help her. Quickly!

240
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:00,373
Ba-tang, are you okay?

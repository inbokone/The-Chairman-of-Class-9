1
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:13,511
You're doing so well.
Why do you look sad?

2
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:16,083
Let's be friends from now on.

3
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:36,271
MOON SUNG-HYUN

4
00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:40,276
KIM SHI-KYUNG

5
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:42,445
HYUN-SUK

6
00:00:45,647 --> 00:00:48,115
HWANG HYE-JIN, CHA JUN-HYUK,
CHOI JI-HYE, LEE HYO-BIN

7
00:00:48,483 --> 00:00:50,786
KIM KYUNG-MIN, KI HYUN-WOO,
KIM WON-HOON, LEE CHANG-HO

8
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:03,999
THE CHAIRMAN IS LEVEL 9

9
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:10,004
PLACES, CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

10
00:01:10,384 --> 00:01:11,384
Hey, Eun-bin!

11
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,610
Let's talk!

12
00:01:15,817 --> 00:01:17,834
I have nothing to say, so just go!

13
00:01:18,306 --> 00:01:21,682
The one who bullies you
is Se-ra, not Ba-tang!

14
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,251
Why on earth would you lie like this?

15
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:26,987
Don't talk if you don't know anything!

16
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,826
I heard you both were close friends!

17
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:35,616
Why are you doing this?

18
00:02:22,984 --> 00:02:24,458
Yi-soo, you're here!

19
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,100
How about Ba-tang?

20
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:28,615
Is she okay?

21
00:02:33,341 --> 00:02:34,341
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:39,594
We will do our best to help
Ba-tang return to school.

23
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:40,427
Yes.

24
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:46,379
This is all my fault.

25
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:52,873
Her mom is powerless and poor.

26
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:59,513
That's why my daughter
has been suffering injustice.

27
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,529
My unlucky daughter.

28
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:07,087
My poor daughter.

29
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:16,329
We can't just let this day passes by.

30
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:21,668
I feel relieved to think that I don't
have to see her for a while.

31
00:03:21,736 --> 00:03:24,004
- That bitch!
- Not only that.

32
00:03:25,045 --> 00:03:28,326
It'll be hard to go to universities
because of her disciplinary action.

33
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:31,244
Poor Ba-tang. What should I do?

34
00:03:58,956 --> 00:03:59,973
Do you know me?

35
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:01,976
Of course.

36
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:04,611
Koo Se-ra from Balhae High School.

37
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,282
I thought you want us to be friends
since we go to the same school.

38
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,519
Don't bite more than you can chew.

39
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:17,190
I don't only do this to you.

40
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:23,864
You think you can win people's heart
with this cheap whiskey?

41
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,801
You don't have to be nice to everyone.

42
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,980
I'm...

43
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:34,107
I'm willing to give everything
to the person I like.

44
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,276
It's fun.

45
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,019
I heard a lot about you.

46
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,754
What did you hear?

47
00:04:48,578 --> 00:04:51,491
If I go to Balhae High School,
there is a really pretty girl.

48
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,293
Bullshit...

49
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,797
Do you believe that I moved
from my old school to meet you?

50
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:02,736
This transfer student is too bold.

51
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:07,174
Why did Balhae High School
become like that?

52
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:10,159
That kind of incident
has ruined the school's vibes.

53
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,884
Are you aware of the scale?

54
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,269
Speaking of which...

55
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:23,824
Does it make sense a kid like Na Yi-soo
moved to Balhae High School?

56
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:30,530
I was in middle school...

57
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,669
...when I first met him.

58
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:45,212
This is the most interesting thing
you've said so far.

59
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:52,252
Balhae High School is now
at a crossroad.

60
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:56,585
Will it remain as an ordinary school,
or will it be reborn as a great school...

61
00:05:56,618 --> 00:05:58,859
...that the world will pay attention to?

62
00:05:59,895 --> 00:06:03,496
From now on, we will be with you
to create a better future.

63
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:05,165
For Balhae High School!

64
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:07,623
Cheers!

65
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:17,110
The Chairman has been working hard.

66
00:06:17,876 --> 00:06:21,848
It's not true.
Isn’t this a win-win situation?

67
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:28,054
As a mother, I felt really bad
that Se-ra had a weak heart...

68
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,290
...and she could only hold back.

69
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:36,733
But thanks to our chairman,
it feels like my sick tooth has fell off.

70
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:42,602
For Balhae High to be a good school,
the president’s help is important.

71
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:48,508
Because being an elite family requires
the strength of many people.

72
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,550
Teacher Baek, are you not in
a good mood today?

73
00:06:58,547 --> 00:06:59,686
It's not like that.

74
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:03,590
Are you thinking about when will
you become a full-time teacher?

75
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:07,620
Could it be, that day
you were enchanted?

76
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:12,658
Teacher Baek.

77
00:07:14,493 --> 00:07:15,869
In life…

78
00:07:16,931 --> 00:07:22,108
…you can't live only doing
what you want to do.

79
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:38,431
Are you busy?

80
00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:43,463
I have to study,
even when I'm suspended.

81
00:07:44,926 --> 00:07:47,067
You haven't eaten for a few days.

82
00:07:49,471 --> 00:07:51,171
So what should I do?

83
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:56,409
My dream to study
in a university has ruined!

84
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,324
Are you going to
just sit there and suffer?

85
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,519
You saw it, too.
There's nothing I can do.

86
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,042
Because I've been ruined, too.

87
00:08:13,265 --> 00:08:18,365
That's why you should
do something and fight!

88
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:26,172
Hey.

89
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,674
Damn, buddy!

90
00:08:27,818 --> 00:08:30,977
To dance zero two, you need to
have your pelvis properly aligned.

91
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:33,148
Can you do it like this?

92
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,750
I'm sorry...

93
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:39,487
Can you just let me go this time?

94
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,089
What the hell?
He has grown a pair now.

95
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,657
Hey.

96
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,295
Just do what I told you to do.
Don't resist.

97
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:51,984
You just have to do it.

98
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,501
If you don't, we will singe
your thighs with this cigarette.

99
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,203
Okay, ready. Action!

100
00:08:57,956 --> 00:08:59,089
That's good.

101
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,257
I told you not to bother
the kids, right?

102
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,718
It was so fun...

103
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:15,755
Damn, Na Yi-soo.
Can you drop your nice guy act?

104
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:17,891
I hate bastards like you.

105
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,393
Let's go.

106
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:21,728
Hey.

107
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:23,730
I heard his dad...

108
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:27,332
...deliberately caused the accident
because he wanted to marry another woman.

109
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:32,505
What?

110
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,808
Hey, is that what rich people do?

111
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,046
If you get tired of your wife,
you change her right away?

112
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:40,080
Yi-soo's dad is a real man.

113
00:09:40,671 --> 00:09:43,425
But Yi-soo's mom is really beautiful...

114
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,421
Don't talk nonsense
when you don't know anything.

115
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:53,993
Bastard!

116
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:11,668
Expel him.

117
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,652
I'm not guilty.

118
00:10:20,682 --> 00:10:21,682
I know.

119
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:24,057
But why did you do that?

120
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:31,831
You think you're the only one
who's treated unfairly in this world?

121
00:10:33,693 --> 00:10:37,637
Eventually the truth will come out,
but you don't have patience to wait.

122
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,351
How much longer I have to endure it?

123
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:48,848
You will have to endure it
when I die one day.

124
00:10:57,546 --> 00:10:59,149
Have you investigated it?

125
00:11:00,456 --> 00:11:01,390
Yes.

126
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:05,796
Just like you said, a few days
before the accident...

127
00:11:06,325 --> 00:11:09,502
...Director Na Jun
visited the car service center.

128
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:14,707
Only the footage from that date
deleted from the black box.

129
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:17,439
Proceed quietly.

130
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:21,347
If you make a fuss,
I might lose Yi-soo.

131
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:23,649
Master...

132
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,357
I will take good care of him.

133
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:31,036
Please.

134
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:37,530
Maybe if I go first...

135
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:51,287
Why me?

136
00:11:54,722 --> 00:11:56,680
This is the petition
from the students.

137
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:03,590
We have written our honest testimony
about Ba-tang's character as a student.

138
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:09,429
This must have big impact to
emotional and immature kids like you.

139
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,600
So I understand that you
want to be on her side.

140
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:17,303
But you better stop this
because my mind is made up.

141
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,954
You think I only prepared this?

142
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:27,875
Se-ra.

143
00:12:29,678 --> 00:12:34,455
Why do you really hate Ba-tang?

144
00:12:35,473 --> 00:12:38,992
Just like you couldn't defeat Yi-soo
in your entire life...

145
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:44,297
...I couldn't push Ba-tang away
with my own strength.

146
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:50,436
Is it possible that you haven't
used all means or methods?

147
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,440
You think I haven't tried it?

148
00:12:55,494 --> 00:12:57,644
I did everything I could
to push her away.

149
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:01,180
How did you do it?

150
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:24,332
Chairman, I'm not gonna die
like this alone.

151
00:13:24,802 --> 00:13:27,573
I will expose everything
that has happened so far...

152
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:34,283
Please save me and my family.

153
00:13:35,283 --> 00:13:36,749
I will do everything!

154
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:47,427
Yes. Teacher Yoo has arrived.

155
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,291
Principal.

156
00:14:01,054 --> 00:14:05,707
If you have any suggestion,
please let me know...

157
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,415
Who are you?

158
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:19,759
My God!

159
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:22,729
There's an old saying that says,
"A teacher is like the sky."

160
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:29,302
Make a nice knot
and hang him high in the sky.

161
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:36,809

<i>There is no better place to hide it</i>
<i>beside Ba-tang's.</i>

163
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:46,424
<i>There's no particular reason</i>
<i>to do that.</i>

164
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:48,730
<i>I can just kill...</i>

165
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,260
It looks you want to make
big deal out of this.

166
00:14:55,392 --> 00:14:56,696
If that's the case...

167
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:59,892
...I have no choice
but to leak this story.

168
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,369
It can be a good newspaper article.

169
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:07,006
Wait, wait!

170
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:11,110
I got it. Really.

171
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,580
So let's talk about it first.

172
00:15:15,444 --> 00:15:16,582
Ba-tang...

173
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:19,285
Let her come back to the school.

174
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,120
What kind of person
playing baseball late at night?

175
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,582
That would be me.

176
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:52,084
Your body still hurts?

177
00:15:54,803 --> 00:15:56,789
They say it's youth because it hurts.

178
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,791
If it hurts, you need to go
to the hospital.

179
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:02,295
If you keep holding your pain,
you will get a big problem.

180
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,130
I will hold until this match.

181
00:16:25,774 --> 00:16:28,221
- Give me your bag.
- No need.

182
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:31,591
- I said, give me your bag!
- I said, no!

183
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:35,395
Why are you so angry?

184
00:16:36,356 --> 00:16:38,030
Am I so fucking pitiful?

185
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:39,517
What?

186
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,668
Funny isn't it, to see people quit
baseball because they got injured?

187
00:16:43,982 --> 00:16:46,839
I don't need your help,
so get the hell out of here!

188
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,560
Dae-hee.

189
00:16:49,928 --> 00:16:51,677
Come to your fucking senses!

190
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,170
Damn you.

191
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:06,392
Dae-hee, let's go now.

192
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:14,600
<i>- Would you like a cigarette?</i>
<i>- No, I have one too.</i>

193
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:15,569
<i>Come on, Dae-hee.</i>

194
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,304
<i>- I got pierced.</i>
<i>- Where?</i>

195
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:28,132
You are so weak.

196
00:17:29,954 --> 00:17:32,452
So what? Do you want to try?

197
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:34,654
What do you say?

198
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:41,093
Thank you, for doing me a favor.

199
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,397
What should I do now?

200
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:47,264
Now I'm the bastard who stuck
a knife in his dad's back.

201
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:50,469
So what should you do?

202
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:53,105
Just live your own life.

203
00:17:59,081 --> 00:18:00,448
HAN BA-TANG

204
00:18:02,272 --> 00:18:06,018
Ba-tang. Did the school call you?

1
00:00:14,838 --> 00:00:16,183
Don't come closer!

2
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,185
SON EUN-BIN

3
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,280
Is it yours?

4
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:37,304
I'm sorry to bother you,
but can I ask you something?

5
00:00:38,158 --> 00:00:39,158
What?

6
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:45,445
If you attend this school,
you will go to a good university...

7
00:00:46,023 --> 00:00:50,384
...get a good job,
and have a free pass in life.

8
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:52,286
So why are you doing this?

9
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,289
Does it matter?

10
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,092
I'm so unlucky right now.

11
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:04,998
You would feel unlucky
if you go to a school like this.

12
00:01:05,238 --> 00:01:06,800
Save your sympathy!

13
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,971
Usually you don't care about people,
don't act like you care now!

14
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,441
Me? Care about you?

15
00:01:14,996 --> 00:01:18,371
Just go away!
Don't pretend that you care!

16
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:23,715
I'm sorry, but you see me wrong.

17
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,887
What do you want to say?

18
00:01:27,174 --> 00:01:28,488
Just like you...

19
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:33,565
...I want to see this school fail.

20
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,066
But who are you?

21
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,736
I've never seen you before.

22
00:01:43,447 --> 00:01:44,447
Me?

23
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:47,741
The transfer student.

24
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:11,902
MOON SUNG-HYUN

25
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:15,903
KIM SHI-KYUNG

26
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:18,576
HYUN-SUK

27
00:02:19,977 --> 00:02:24,078
HWANG HYE-JIN, CHA JUN-HYUK,
CHOI JI-HYE, LEE HYO-BIN

28
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:27,747
KIM KYUNG-MIN, KI HYUN-WOO,
KIM WON-HOON, LEE CHANG-HO

29
00:02:35,424 --> 00:02:37,925
THE CHAIRMAN IS LEVEL 9

30
00:02:40,962 --> 00:02:43,932
PLACES, CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

31
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:45,766
Just hold it back.

32
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:49,078
Se-ra's greatest achievement is
that she has lovely parents.

33
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,427
She's very rude and annoying
day by day.

34
00:02:53,562 --> 00:02:55,257
She has a big ego,
she acts like that...

35
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:59,146
...because she can't be the head of
student body or to be the top student.

36
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:01,948
If she feels it's unfair,
why didn't she work harder?

37
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,918
Why would she blame me?

38
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,889
There's a reason
why she became more sensitive.

39
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:10,463
What is it?

40
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:13,427
She's got rejected by Ro-woon.

41
00:03:20,986 --> 00:03:22,860
What do you want to say?

42
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:25,492
Se-ra...

43
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:27,282
Yes. What?

44
00:03:28,861 --> 00:03:31,478
I wish you wouldn't do
something like that.

45
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:35,205
What do you mean?

46
00:03:37,165 --> 00:03:40,087
Arenâ€™t we all friends
no matter how we got in?

47
00:03:40,712 --> 00:03:44,791
Social worker, or something...
You shouldn't say that.

48
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,061
They are the ones who went too far.

49
00:03:48,798 --> 00:03:51,698
They're lucky they can study here!

50
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:54,601
They should keep their mouth shut!

51
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:58,438
They think we're on the same level
and can do anything!

52
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,223
- Do you think it's fair?
- So...

53
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,612
...what is so special about you?

54
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:22,295
Going to school every day
feels like hell.

55
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:26,133
My mom says she's proud of me
for attending Balhae High School.

56
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,319
But she doesn't care
that I am suffering like this.

57
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,107
They want me to be grateful.

58
00:04:35,278 --> 00:04:39,446
That I can study in this school,
thanks to the chairman.

59
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,316
If my father is just an employee,
should I bow down too?!

60
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:49,790
There is no way...

61
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:51,625
Are you sleeping?

62
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,404
I feel sleepy after eating.

63
00:05:01,905 --> 00:05:03,570
If you are done talking, I go.

64
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,807
Wait!

65
00:05:10,498 --> 00:05:13,313
What? Do you have
another thing to say?

66
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,050
Why do you hate this school that much?

67
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:21,521
There was a person I really hate.

68
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,324
He loved this school very much.

69
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,828
That's why I want to ruin it.

70
00:05:29,123 --> 00:05:30,730
How are you going to ruin it?

71
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:37,504
If you want to know how I do it,
come down and go with me.

72
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:00,927
Oh, shit!

73
00:06:05,502 --> 00:06:07,602
BALHAE HIGH SCHOOL

74
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:15,242
When I opened the door, Na Yi-soo
threw himself in and hugged Eun-bin.

75
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,677
So, Yi-soo were saving Eun-bin?

76
00:06:17,828 --> 00:06:20,080
That's so cool!

77
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,549
He just moved here,
but he has caused a real impact.

78
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:26,620
I'm still little nervous
just to talk about it.

79
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:30,023
Anyway, I'm really glad.

80
00:06:30,148 --> 00:06:32,759
It we came a bit late,
it would be a big problem.

81
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:44,605
Na Yi-soo...

82
00:06:44,648 --> 00:06:45,805
What the hell?

83
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,307
Don't do that!

84
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,042
Yi-soo.

85
00:06:49,224 --> 00:06:51,044
I think you are very amazing.

86
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:54,681
If it was me, I would have been too scared
to do anything in that situation.

87
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:57,517
What are you saying?

88
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:59,819
You saved Eun-bin yesterday!

89
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:03,356
Yi-soo, you are so cool!

90
00:07:05,273 --> 00:07:07,094
No, she said she was coming down...

91
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:10,096
Did you hold her there
in case she fell?

92
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,787
Na Yi-soo...

93
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:23,944
You got a nice welcome here.

94
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:29,049
The school atmosphere became
chaotic since you moved here.

95
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:33,053
It seems there are too many
problems here already.

96
00:07:34,298 --> 00:07:36,389
There are problems wherever you go.

97
00:07:36,795 --> 00:07:40,293
But I say this because there are people
who keep adding the problem.

98
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:42,929
Just go quietly.

99
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,464
Everyone is being sensitive.

100
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,299
Well, yeah.

101
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,301
Quietly.

102
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
Number four.

103
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:02,615
It's the time already.

104
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:05,018
Does anyone have any question?

105
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,310
Who are you?

106
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,997
I am the new ethics teacher.

107
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:30,413
DON'T LIVE LIKE A PUSHOVER

108
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:34,481
Let's live well, let's live right.

109
00:08:34,976 --> 00:08:37,851
You know this is useless, right?

110
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:42,530
If you live like a pushover,
life just gets so tiring.

111
00:08:51,099 --> 00:08:54,634
I don't like the clothes,
I want to get a refund.

112
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,803
So, what should I do?

113
00:08:58,013 --> 00:09:04,711
I am sorry. Maybe if you don't mind,
is it okay if I ask for a refund?

114
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:12,185
Is that your best?

115
00:09:15,532 --> 00:09:17,090
Okay, repeat after me.

116
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,792
Sister.

117
00:09:19,446 --> 00:09:20,527
Sister.

118
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,963
You've been doing this for a long time.
Why this is happening?

119
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,188
You've been doing this
for a long time...

120
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,519
I can't do it.

121
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:31,771
With a mindset like this...

122
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,015
...you canâ€™t get refund for four pairs
of socks worth 1,000 won!

123
00:09:35,048 --> 00:09:36,281
Do it again!

124
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:37,610
I'm...

125
00:09:38,064 --> 00:09:40,213
- I'm sorry.
- Do it again.

126
00:09:40,392 --> 00:09:41,413
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:42,446
Do it again!

128
00:09:43,556 --> 00:09:44,818
<i>Again!</i>

129
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,220
She teaches a good thing...

130
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:48,956
<i>Again!</i>

131
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:50,824
She's an excellent teacher.

132
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:53,460
This is a new way of education.

133
00:09:54,407 --> 00:09:55,407
<i>Again!</i>

134
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,106
NEW BOOK

135
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:18,618
What's wrong with your expression?

136
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:21,287
Is this your first time seeing
a DJ in a library?

137
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:31,598
Wow, it's amazing.

138
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,907
So this is how they run this school?

139
00:10:38,947 --> 00:10:40,340
These kids...

140
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,710
When I raise the tension a little,
they get very distracted.

141
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,649
They can't study for the test
with that noise.

142
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,420
There's a good thing happened?

143
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:56,389
What?

144
00:10:57,314 --> 00:10:58,858
How long have you been there?

145
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,466
Thanks for yesterday.

146
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:13,006
I thought I was a bit crazy.
I shouldn't do that.

147
00:11:14,252 --> 00:11:16,576
You should go home and sleep.

148
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:21,214
How can I go anywhere?
I'm too embarrassed.

149
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,817
Don't die, no matter how hard it is.

150
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:28,154
What?

151
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:29,756
What's the point of dying?

152
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,559
If you have the courage,
do something else.

153
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:34,666
For example...

154
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:41,756
Break all the school windows,
say, "F*ck the schools in Korea!"

155
00:11:44,158 --> 00:11:46,606
Shouting, and then hit it.

156
00:11:47,838 --> 00:11:50,577
How can you do that?
It's so childish.

157
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,614
Just keep on living, then.

158
00:11:56,478 --> 00:11:57,758
Like a lobster.

159
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:08,725
Na Yi-soo.

160
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:11,931
I think you're a really good guy.

161
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:17,470
Even though the tone
it's a bit cheesy...

162
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:19,672
...I know you said that
because you're worried.

163
00:12:21,155 --> 00:12:22,842
Looking at it right now...

164
00:12:23,304 --> 00:12:25,678
...you have a tendency
to do whatever you want.

165
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,282
That's why you don't like me?

166
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:34,921
What? Is there such a thing
as like and dislike?

167
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,029
Give me your number.

168
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:52,672
You must know, I'm giving you my number
it's not because that I like you.

169
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,944
I'm giving it just in case you might do
something strange again.

170
00:12:58,635 --> 00:12:59,635
I got it.

171
00:13:01,002 --> 00:13:02,181
I will call you.

172
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:09,055
She's doing whatever she wants again.

173
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,591
If there is anything I can help,
please let me know.

174
00:13:13,838 --> 00:13:15,561
You said you want to ruin the school.

175
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:33,613
You already got hit by a girl?

176
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:35,251
I'm surprised.

177
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:37,647
Attorney Hwang...

178
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:40,853
...why did you come here so suddenly?

179
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:44,257
I heard there was a trouble at school,
so I was a little worried.

180
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:47,794
But, you're doing better than I thought.

181
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,734
Damn.

182
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:52,432
It's not like that!

183
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,935
If there is anything I can help,
please let me know.

184
00:13:56,137 --> 00:13:57,788
You said you want to ruin the school.

185
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,891
BALHAE HIGH SCHOOL
CHAIRMAN NA SEONG

186
00:14:07,477 --> 00:14:08,581
What's wrong?

187
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,917
This is my seat, right?

188
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:16,556
You're not officially appointed yet,
you can't do what you like.

189
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,094
You're so uptight. People
wouldn't think you're a lawyer.

190
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:25,265
So if I stay until the graduation,
this school will be mine?

191
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:29,502
Why do you bring military-style meals
and DJs at the library?

192
00:14:30,455 --> 00:14:33,704
And where did you get
that tough woman from?

193
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,175
Since the kids here didn't have
any fighting spirit...

194
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,144
...I tried to fill some in them.

195
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,880
Aggressively and in a hard way!

196
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:45,051
If you continue to do things like that,
the problem may become bigger.

197
00:14:46,137 --> 00:14:47,120
Problem?

198
00:14:47,926 --> 00:14:50,923
I am the chairman,
what kind of problem is getting bigger?

199
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:54,927
Yesterday, your uncle came to visit.

200
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,911
Attorney Hwang.
It's been a long time.

201
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,116
You haven't changed.
Doing all the works alone.

202
00:15:18,326 --> 00:15:20,219
Why did you come
without telling me first?

203
00:15:21,844 --> 00:15:24,056
I don't have to tell you anything!

204
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:27,994
It's definitely my company now, isn't it?

205
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:33,099
You've been working hard.

206
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:38,137
It happened to Seong so suddenly,
and I was really confused.

207
00:15:38,968 --> 00:15:43,054
But I'm glad you're so tough mentally.

208
00:15:44,265 --> 00:15:46,879
You are welcome.
It's something that I have to do.

209
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:53,453
Now I have to come to my senses.
I should lead our company well.

210
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,210
But...

211
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,429
I came here because
I felt something strange.

212
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:07,700
What do you mean?

213
00:16:08,273 --> 00:16:14,240
Even the goldfish
had its share of inheritance.

214
00:16:15,985 --> 00:16:19,742
Balhae High School.
I don't know who gets that.

215
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:26,163
Balhae High School,
what happened to it?

216
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,526
I think you need to be careful
about your uncle.

217
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:37,445
Because he has been aiming
the chairman position for a long time.

218
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,300
He is also greedy.

219
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:45,137
And now he wants to own the school?

220
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:48,028
But...

221
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:53,546
Would he be greedy for a school
that is so broken?

222
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,629
- Shall we do this?
- Yeah, cheers!

223
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:07,927
I feel relieved these days because
I don't see that bastard Na Yi-soo.

224
00:17:08,637 --> 00:17:12,332
Thanks to the true education
given to us by Dae-heeâ€™s father.

225
00:17:12,403 --> 00:17:14,667
Yeah. Of course.

226
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:17,136
I wish you guys saw it.

227
00:17:17,442 --> 00:17:20,940
That bastard got down on his knees
and begged me to spare him...

228
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:22,842
...but he looked like an idiot.

229
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:24,877
His Majesty Na Yi-soo knelt down?

230
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:28,982
That idiot, I thought that day
would come someday.

231
00:17:29,021 --> 00:17:31,784
He used to make fun of me for fighting.

232
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:35,488
But the class is different
in the world of pros.

233
00:17:36,795 --> 00:17:37,757
Hey!

234
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:43,729
Your father's organization,
I mean your father's company...

235
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:45,464
...will be inherited to you, right?

236
00:17:47,795 --> 00:17:49,569
Yeah, of course.

237
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,004
You can say it's already mine.

238
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,974
This place is also run by someone
who knows my father.

239
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,377
If you need anything,
please let me know.

240
00:17:58,547 --> 00:18:00,279
You are so cool, Dae-hee.

241
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,982
Just hearing this makes me
feel reassured!

242
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,318
Cheers.

243
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,959
Wait. Did you guys hear this?

244
00:18:13,044 --> 00:18:15,528
I heard Na Yi-soo wearing
a school uniform these days.

245
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,030
Na Yi-soo wears a school uniform?

246
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,668
Didnâ€™t that kid get kicked out
of school after that incident?

247
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:26,604
I know that. Are you sure you didn't
confuse him with someone else?

248
00:18:26,653 --> 00:18:29,996
Shit, I heard the kids
at our school saw him.

249
00:18:31,163 --> 00:18:32,163
Dae-hee.

250
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:36,449
How much did you tease that kid?

251
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:39,796
Does he wear a cosplay
that he doesnâ€™t normally do?

252
00:18:41,465 --> 00:18:45,524
No, I just scared him a little.

253
00:18:45,804 --> 00:18:48,461
Wow, seriously?

254
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:49,850
That's cool.

255
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:53,374
That's really cool.
Let's have a drink.

256
00:18:57,806 --> 00:19:00,081
BALHAE HIGH SCHOOL
HAS GONE CRAZY TODAY.

257
00:19:00,115 --> 00:19:03,862
- IS THIS THE REAL BALHAE HIGH SCHOOL?
- THIS IS NOT FROM METAVERSE?

258
00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:07,246
A prestigious high school
became crap overnight.

259
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:11,984
Now let's wait the closing
of Balhae High School...

260
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,720
...which has been embroiled
in various controversies!

261
00:19:18,322 --> 00:19:19,657
Give me your lighter.

262
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:25,898
Isn't he Na Yi-soo?

263
00:19:26,353 --> 00:19:29,268
See, I told you.
That bastard wears a school uniform.

264
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:33,139
When I see that kid smiling,
I know he doesn't come to his senses yet.

265
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,840
Hey, Dae-hee.

266
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:38,811
This time, you have to press it
so he can't even climb up, right?

267
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:43,315
- What?
- This should be fun. Let's go!

268
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,683
Damn it!

269
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:51,758
Hey, Na Yi-soo!

270
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:54,727
It's been a long time.

271
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:56,862
Long time no see.

272
00:19:57,478 --> 00:19:58,918
Are you sober now?

273
00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:02,301
Balhae High School?

274
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,337
What are you doing
in this shitty school?

275
00:20:06,544 --> 00:20:08,040
I know it's silly.

276
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,950
- But just go.
- Just go?

277
00:20:15,621 --> 00:20:17,183
What are you going to do
if we don't go?

278
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:21,112
I heard you got down on your knees
and prayed so hard.

279
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:24,256
So, you should be more humble.

280
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:27,560
Who got down on his knees? Me?

281
00:20:34,257 --> 00:20:38,070
- I'm tired today,
- You can't just go.

282
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:40,406
Donâ€™t we have a score to settle?

283
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,442
Do you want to get hit again?

284
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,679
You still don't understand, do you?

285
00:20:47,214 --> 00:20:49,648
Do you want me to knock down
all of your teeth?

286
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:52,218
What are you doing?

287
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,256
Na Yi-soo, do you know these guys?

288
00:20:58,484 --> 00:20:59,992
I will take care of it.

289
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,328
So why don't you just go?

290
00:21:03,585 --> 00:21:05,664
This kid is making a fuss
in front of this girl?

291
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:07,867
Do you like this kind of girl?

292
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,738
I don't know what's going on,
but violence is not the answer.

293
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,793
If there's a problem, let's talk...

294
00:21:14,842 --> 00:21:19,145
If you don't know what's going on,
get out of here.

295
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,714
Don't be around and get screwed.

296
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:31,924
I said I wanted to live quietly,
the kids couldn't understand me.

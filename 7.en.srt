HWANG HYE-JIN, CHA JUN-HYUK,

00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:49,020
KIM KYUNG-MIN, KI HYUN-WOO,
KIM WON-HOON, LEE CHANG-HO

6
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:02,265
THE CHAIRMAN IS LEVEL 9

7
00:01:05,302 --> 00:01:08,270
PLACES, CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

8
00:01:21,794 --> 00:01:22,794
Ba-tang...

9
00:01:23,747 --> 00:01:24,825
Are you okay?

10
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,821
Mom, my exam...

11
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:41,168
Don't worry about that.
Just get some rest.

12
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:02,155
Guys!

13
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:04,324
Ba-tang already woke up!

14
00:02:06,405 --> 00:02:09,033
Is she really okay?

15
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:10,165
Yes.

16
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:14,101
I just talked to her mom on the phone.
She said Ba-tang's fine.

17
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,307
I was shocked, I thought
it was something serious.

18
00:02:21,163 --> 00:02:22,943
My hand is still shaking.

19
00:02:24,085 --> 00:02:27,499
So, what about her exam?

20
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:30,250
She's got zero point.

21
00:02:32,374 --> 00:02:33,720
It's nonsense.

22
00:02:34,857 --> 00:02:37,190
You know how hard she studied for it?

23
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:38,828
I know.

24
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:42,162
This is the first time Han Ba-tang
loses her first place.

25
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:45,799
She was still fine this morning.

26
00:02:47,187 --> 00:02:49,169
How could this happen?

27
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:53,307
SECOND GRADE FIRST SEMESTER
FINAL EXAM TOP 30

28
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,443
What is this, Koo Se-ra?
Finally you got first place.

29
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
That's right.

30
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:08,400
- Koo Se-ra, congratulations!
- Congratulations!

31
00:03:09,827 --> 00:03:12,397
Why did this take so long?

32
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:15,786
- This is where I belong.
- That's right.

33
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:18,799
Ba-tang didn't fit
to be in the first place.

34
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:22,235
Young and rich like Se-ra is the best fit
for Balhae High School's number one.

35
00:03:22,647 --> 00:03:25,412
Since we organized the ranking
properly this time...

36
00:03:25,445 --> 00:03:28,475
...Han Ba-tang will go back
to her original position, right?

37
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:30,877
Down below.

38
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:34,448
Now school will return to normal.

39
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,652
Of course.
We are really having fun today.

40
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:41,254
Cheers!

41
00:03:43,118 --> 00:03:44,118
But...

42
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:49,258
Don't you think the more is merrier?

43
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,720
Let me go instead.

44
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:17,041
What would we do when
the beautiful chef left the diner...

45
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,860
...and all the regular
customers are gone?

46
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,531
I am okay, so don't worry.

47
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:27,134
You daughter is not that weak.

48
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:37,611
- I'll be back soon.
- Be careful.

49
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:47,301
Who is that?

50
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:56,596
Wow, she's really coming.

51
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:03,937
I wonder how good your tteokbokki is.

52
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,973
But I didn't know
you would come to deliver it.

53
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,012
I thought a rich girl like you
wouldn't eat this.

54
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:15,749
Of course we won't eat it.

55
00:05:16,644 --> 00:05:21,697
Noblesse oblige, I'm just trying to help
the sales of my friend's diner...

56
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:24,219
...out of social consideration
that you like so much.

57
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,626
Why? You don't like it?

58
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:32,465
I don't need your consideration,
so I will give you a refund.

59
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,275
I ordered many items in the menu
and the total is less than 100,000 won.

60
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,346
But I guess you have a difficulty
to give me a refund.

61
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,283
Hey! You look so pathetic right now.

62
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,755
The kids who don't have much
are full of pride.

63
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:05,366
Ba-tang.

64
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,102
Looks like a nice day, have fun.

65
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:15,654
Let go!

66
00:06:16,654 --> 00:06:17,644
Ba-tang.

67
00:06:17,913 --> 00:06:19,704
I think there's some misunderstanding.

68
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,192
I'm sorry...

69
00:06:21,723 --> 00:06:26,653
I forgot that you and I
are from different worlds.

70
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:29,566
It's not like that...

71
00:06:30,987 --> 00:06:32,092
I'm going.

72
00:06:37,684 --> 00:06:38,942
What have you done?

73
00:06:40,462 --> 00:06:42,002
And what about you?

74
00:06:43,497 --> 00:06:45,767
When I call you, you never answer.

75
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:49,342
But when I told you Ba-tang was drunk,
you immediately came here.

76
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:52,612
What do you want from lying like that?

77
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,453
You should know.
Please congratulate me.

78
00:07:23,078 --> 00:07:24,078
MOM

79
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,568
- Yes, Mom?
<i>- Why are you late?</i>

80
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,579
I have done my delivery
and my friends are here.

81
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:37,924
So, I'm having a chat
with my friends right now.

82
00:07:38,227 --> 00:07:41,530
<i>You didn't come home right away.</i>
<i>I thought something happened to you.</i>

83
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:42,996
<i>Okay, then.</i>

84
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:48,869
- Don't worry.
<i>- Okay.</i>

85
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:04,584
What are you doing here?

86
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,856
Are you okay?

87
00:08:30,035 --> 00:08:32,080
Koo Se-ra is really mean.

88
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:35,929
At first, I tried to ignore her.

89
00:08:36,675 --> 00:08:39,552
But these days, it seems like
she was born to harass me.

90
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:44,758
When entering school, we should take
a personality test instead of academic.

91
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,194
They should just expel her.

92
00:08:49,465 --> 00:08:51,698
You're not the chairman.
How can you do that?

93
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,188
Yeah...

94
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:56,403
I'm just saying.

95
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:58,872
Do you have T personality?

96
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:05,512
But still, sometimes I think...

97
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:09,883
What would it be like
if I was born into a rich family?

98
00:09:11,353 --> 00:09:14,521
Maybe I could live my life
without hiding my guilt...

99
00:09:15,036 --> 00:09:18,053
...to see my mom
working so hard to feed me.

100
00:09:19,881 --> 00:09:23,715
If your mother became a rich lady...

101
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,528
...then we wouldn't have the world’s
most delicious tteokbokki shop.

102
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:30,070
It's not comforting at all.

103
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,337
Hey...

104
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,007
How blessed you are to have a mom
who is good at cooking.

105
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,276
My mom's cooking...

106
00:09:37,886 --> 00:09:38,978
...is so bad.

107
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:40,947
You have T personality, too.

108
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:44,084
Your mom would be upset
if she hear this.

109
00:09:45,487 --> 00:09:47,821
I miss seeing her upset face.

110
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:53,326
She has passed away.

111
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,624
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

112
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,433
It was a long time ago.

113
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,236
You make me think about her.

114
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,148
So you want her to take the test again?

115
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,220
You know Ba-tang suddenly collapsed
and had to go to the hospital.

116
00:10:21,435 --> 00:10:23,876
And she studied harder
for this test than anyone else.

117
00:10:25,011 --> 00:10:26,939
Maintaining your condition
is also important.

118
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:32,065
If it was a college entrance exam,
would they accept that reason?

119
00:10:32,995 --> 00:10:35,535
Everyone took the test
under the same conditions.

120
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:37,937
So how can you give a special
treatment to just one person?

121
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:43,276
What is happening at the school now
is because you...

122
00:10:43,749 --> 00:10:45,912
...follow the instructions
of the new chairman.

123
00:10:47,457 --> 00:10:50,383
Do you handle everything fairly?

124
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,852
Na Yi-soo!

125
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,323
You're just admitted here,
you should act like a student!

126
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,561
I don't know what is your relationship
with the new chairman.

127
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:04,798
My point is, the more you do this,
the more difficult your situation will be.

128
00:11:05,107 --> 00:11:06,733
Thank you for your advice.

129
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,637
Because I'm the type of person
who speaks my mind.

130
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,041
I'm telling you once again,
there is no retest.

131
00:11:15,773 --> 00:11:19,712
That is my rule and belief
that I must uphold as a principal.

132
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:50,243
The doctor said they found
sleeping pill in my body that day.

133
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,713
<i>I drank the peppermint tea</i>
<i>my mom gave me.</i>

134
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,715
<i>I think there was sleeping pill in it.</i>

135
00:11:56,583 --> 00:12:01,221
My mom thought it's all her fault,
but that doesn't make sense.

136
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,806
The tea that I always drink
without problem...

137
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,125
...suddenly contains sleeping pill.

138
00:12:07,004 --> 00:12:09,996
So maybe someone put it
in there on purpose?

139
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,342
I have what you asked me.

140
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:24,511
But are you sure?

141
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,305
Of what?

142
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:31,384
If it is revealed that someone
intentionally put sleeping pills...

143
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,087
...not only all students
have to retake the test...

144
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,356
...but bigger problems could arise.

145
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:43,897
If someone did that on purpose,
shouldn’t we reveal it?

146
00:12:56,002 --> 00:12:59,546
This is the hallway CCTV
on the day of the exam.

147
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:06,781
There are no students from other classes
entering the classroom.

148
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,256
Especially the student
whom we suspect, Koo Se-ra.

149
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,391
She was still in the classroom.

150
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,795
This can't be happening...

151
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:41,821
I'm busy.
What do you want to talk about?

152
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:44,011
Teacher...

153
00:13:44,972 --> 00:13:46,615
You really are a great person.

154
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,063
Every year, students from
prestigious universities praise you.

155
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:55,601
They say you teach much better
than most instructors.

156
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,004
You just realize it now?

157
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,641
If you have a great teacher,
you should work hard...

158
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,543
...and you won't fail your exam.

159
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,479
Are you worried about me now?

160
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,283
Stop talking nonsense,
what do you want to talk about?

161
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,472
Did the reality hit you?

162
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:14,573
If your skill is so great,...

163
00:14:15,526 --> 00:14:18,714
...it would be a waste to be
stuck in a school like this.

164
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,262
Hey, there are things
you can't say to the teacher.

165
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,065
I think you have crossed the line.

166
00:14:26,762 --> 00:14:27,667
I think so.

167
00:14:28,404 --> 00:14:29,307
Teacher.

168
00:14:30,582 --> 00:14:31,938
Why did you do that?

169
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:56,962
<i>She studied hard for that exam</i>
<i>by reducing sleep for several days,...</i>

170
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,868
<i>...but you ruined her hard work!</i>

171
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:13,846
Today, you're acting
like nothing happened.

172
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:29,922
Who are you?

173
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:34,634
Why did you suddenly appear
and annoys people with your antics?

174
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,270
Die. Just die!

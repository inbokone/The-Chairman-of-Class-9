1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:00,625
NOTICE.

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,065
DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF THE
IMPEACHMENT MOTION FOR THE CHAIRMAN,

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,643
THE AUTHORITY AS CHAIRMAN IS TRANSFERRED
TO CHAIRMAN NA JUN OF BIG PICTURE CO. LTD.

4
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:11,000
So, what will happen
to the new chairman?

5
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,114
He can't do anything now, right?

6
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:17,071
Even though it was a little strange,

7
00:00:17,634 --> 00:00:19,102
it was kind of fun.

8
00:00:21,977 --> 00:00:25,225
I wondered when this day would come,
but it came faster than I thought.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,602
Of course.

10
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,959
How much our company has done
for this school?

11
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:50,751
What is it?

12
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:52,286
Oh, so cool.

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,365
Who is he anyway?

14
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:15,476
MOON SUNG-HYUN

15
00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:19,482
KIM SHI-KYUNG

16
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:21,685
HYUN-SUK

17
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:27,322
HWANG HYE-JIN, CHA JUN-HYUK,
CHOI JI-HYE, LEE HYO-BIN

18
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,991
KIM KYUNG-MIN, KI HYUN-WOO,
KIM WON-HOON, LEE CHANG-HO

19
00:01:40,704 --> 00:01:43,206
THE CHAIRMAN IS LEVEL 9

20
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:49,219
PLACES, CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

21
00:01:52,353 --> 00:01:55,087
WE HAVE ANOTHER
TRANSFER STUDENT IN OUR CLASS.

22
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:58,851
Say hi.

23
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:05,837
I'm Pi Dae-hee.

24
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:09,437
I came to take over this school.
Any objection?

25
00:02:11,672 --> 00:02:13,985
Wow, you have a lot of guts.

26
00:02:15,988 --> 00:02:20,040
I feel like I've seen this somewhere.

27
00:02:25,282 --> 00:02:26,524
Welcome!

28
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:38,525
Let's all help Dae-hee
adapting at our school.

29
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,132
Yes.

30
00:02:41,175 --> 00:02:44,164
So, shall we all start
by shouting our slogans?

31
00:02:44,992 --> 00:02:48,548
We wish victory! We want 100 points!
We wish the best! We wish first place!

32
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:52,005
Balhae! Go! Yeah!

33
00:02:53,648 --> 00:02:56,009
- Let's work hard.
- Yes.

34
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:21,865
Why?

35
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:23,761
No smoking?

36
00:03:25,394 --> 00:03:27,480
Smoking is usually
prohibited in schools.

37
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,563
You ignorant.

38
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:33,246
I'm sorry for being ignorant.
I just knew about this.

39
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:37,050
Did you come to this school
because you knew I am here?

40
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,618
That's right.

41
00:03:39,206 --> 00:03:40,441
Balhae High School.

42
00:03:41,508 --> 00:03:43,766
- Is it prestigious?
- That's why...

43
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:46,508
Why did you come here?

44
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:49,778
You can study here but I can't?

45
00:03:50,782 --> 00:03:53,500
If you just look at test scores,
I was higher than you.

46
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,603
You are on the last place.
I'm right above you.

47
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:02,409
So how did you end up move here?

48
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:06,346
It's easy.

49
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:11,988
Donation admission?

50
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,756
Hey.

51
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,125
They admit you here if you pay them?

52
00:04:19,874 --> 00:04:22,307
Balhae High School is completely ruined...

53
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:32,335
School wasn't fun
after you left like that.

54
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:36,030
In the past, my goal was clear.

55
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:41,348
I don't know about other guys,
but I just need to win.

56
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:42,883
Are you crazy?

57
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:45,538
You follow me here because of that?

58
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,955
Why? I'm trying to come to my senses
and live a little better.

59
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:52,359
At least say that
after you stop smoking.

60
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:12,746
You said you weren't interested
in this kind of thing.

61
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:20,979
Hey.

62
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,690
You...

63
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,525
What is that?

64
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:27,694
What?

65
00:05:28,134 --> 00:05:30,456
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

66
00:05:31,947 --> 00:05:33,010
It's not like that.

67
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:35,656
It's a bit unfamiliar...

68
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,604
Why?

69
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,921
Are you surprised to see
how pretty I am?

70
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,782
How is it?

71
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:56,512
I did makeup.
Should I remove it and see you again?

72
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:59,960
No, I like it now.

73
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:01,478
Really?

74
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:07,634
Not only you changed your appearance,
but you're also more confident.

75
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,738
Do you remember
what you said before?

76
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,175
You said you wanted
to ruin the school.

77
00:06:16,773 --> 00:06:21,681
When I heard it first time,
I thought it was nonsense.

78
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:24,918
But those words strangely
gave me courage.

79
00:06:25,768 --> 00:06:29,522
We don't come to school
with the same mindset anyway.

80
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,826
I don't think I should just study.

81
00:06:35,215 --> 00:06:37,564
So I started having a new dream.

82
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:56,316
Yeay! Daily makeup is done!

83
00:06:57,011 --> 00:07:02,034
Just by changing your makeup method,
you can become so pretty.

84
00:07:02,104 --> 00:07:04,104
I think you should try it, too.

85
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:10,463
If my video was helpful, please subscribe,
like, and turn on notifications.

86
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,199
Bye...

87
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:19,492
You're better than I thought.

88
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,336
That's right.

89
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:25,078
I'm proud of myself because I think
I'm so good at something!

90
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:30,646
THANKS TO YOU, A LIGHT HAS COME.

91
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:33,853
All my life, I've been wanting
to get support from a lot of people.

92
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,122
That's why I'm happy now.

93
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:40,527
Of course, I have a long way to go.

94
00:07:43,075 --> 00:07:45,799
You say you're happy,
so why are you worried?

95
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,935
My parents don't know about this yet.

96
00:07:50,188 --> 00:07:52,505
If they knew, they would probably
tell me to stop now.

97
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,511
They always compare me to Se-ra
and tell me to come to my senses.

98
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:08,438
Whatever you are doing now is right.

99
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:13,893
So, you shouldn't worry too much.

100
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:24,115
Thank you.

101
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:26,273
Yes.

102
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:28,241
Okay.

103
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,849
But who are you
giving that lip tint to?

104
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,151
Oh, this...

105
00:08:39,631 --> 00:08:41,624
I owe a lot to this person.

106
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,723
This is the way of expressing
my gratitude.

107
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,226
It's not because I like her
or anything like that.

108
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:50,997
I didn't ask, but you
are giving too much information.

109
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,267
Maybe your crush?

110
00:08:55,227 --> 00:08:57,966
Hey, what crush?

111
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,560
You will give it to Ba-tang?

112
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:05,945
What are you talking about?
Why am I giving this to Ba-tang?

113
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:09,691
I think it's right; you're blushing.

114
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:11,951
I said it's not like that.

115
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,312
I think it would suit her well.

116
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:26,433
But she likes Ro-woon.

117
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:29,170
What?

118
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,120
He was close to her
until the freshman year.

119
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,957
She really likes Ro-woon, too.

120
00:09:40,953 --> 00:09:43,222
She doesn't accept him yet
because she can't afford it.

121
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,861
Hey, why are you being like this?

122
00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:01,534
Why? Are you holding your poop?

123
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:02,980
No.

124
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:07,107
So, are you afraid that
someone will come after you?

125
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:10,176
What do you think of me?

126
00:10:11,304 --> 00:10:15,074
But why are you being so restless?

127
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:19,447
Look what time it is
and she hasn't come home.

128
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,223
Who?

129
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,723
Ba-tang?

130
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:26,452
She went out to meet Ro-woon.

131
00:10:26,722 --> 00:10:28,194
That is why!

132
00:10:28,773 --> 00:10:30,541
Shouldn’t you be more worried?

133
00:10:31,054 --> 00:10:33,147
Why are you worried?

134
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:36,503
She was stressed out after the exam.

135
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:39,237
So I told her to have fun.

136
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:43,776
You don't care about
your own daughter.

137
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:44,844
Oh my...

138
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,840
I'm home!

139
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:53,353
- Did you have fun?
- Definitely!

140
00:10:54,694 --> 00:10:59,656
I just wanted to go see a movie,
and I met the director and all the actors.

141
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:00,827
Really?

142
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:06,232
I knew it. Watching movies
in rich people's house is different.

143
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:08,401
But I’m not jealous at all.

144
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,171
I have more fun watching
intense dramas with my mom.

145
00:11:11,247 --> 00:11:14,340
Your words made my day.

146
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,711
You're glad she's home, right?

147
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:20,013
Oh my...

148
00:11:20,404 --> 00:11:21,884
What are you saying?

149
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:24,736
If anyone hears it, they'll think
I've been waiting for her.

150
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:30,557
How was it?
The actor's face was small like this?

151
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:59,254
SON MYUNG-GIL

152
00:12:00,997 --> 00:12:02,159
Are you surprised?

153
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,663
I'm surprised, too.

154
00:12:07,965 --> 00:12:11,631
I should have known earlier when
you carried a bunch of cosmetics.

155
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:14,851
Beauty YouTuber?
What a...

156
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:16,250
How did you know?

157
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:18,905
Subscribe, like, turn on notification...

158
00:12:19,036 --> 00:12:20,507
Damn it!

159
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,490
I didn't know Eun-bin
was this much of a fan.

160
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:29,415
Eun-bin.

161
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,019
You should have a great job to take care
of your dad after he's retired.

162
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,114
Do you know?

163
00:12:37,204 --> 00:12:39,779
He had a hard time getting you
into Balhae High School,...

164
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,629
...but does he know that
you're living your life like this?

165
00:12:42,777 --> 00:12:44,197
Se-ra.

166
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:47,185
When I watch your video,
I can see you are good at lying.

167
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,223
Maybe you can be an actress.

168
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:50,703
Acting...

169
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:55,846
So can I ask you a favor?

170
00:12:57,915 --> 00:13:00,899
What should I do, Se-ra?

171
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:11,841
Do you have something to say?

172
00:13:15,914 --> 00:13:16,914
No.

173
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,496
It's...

174
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:22,902
The weather is good, right?

175
00:13:23,864 --> 00:13:25,465
You're so boring.

176
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,078
The weather...

177
00:13:30,469 --> 00:13:31,469
Ba-tang!

178
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:37,871
What is this?

179
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,620
You used a broken lip tint last time.

180
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:42,954
This is what you use, right?

181
00:13:43,396 --> 00:13:45,186
That's right! how did you know?

182
00:13:46,098 --> 00:13:47,861
We've been knowing
each other for a while.

183
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:50,563
Ro-woon, you can read my mind!

184
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,858
Thank you, I will use it well.

185
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:56,169
Hey, what about me?

186
00:13:57,408 --> 00:13:59,706
You have a lot of cosmetics.

187
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:03,142
Cosmetics are something
you can buy and buy endlessly.

188
00:14:03,397 --> 00:14:06,779
Don't you think you're being unfair
by only taking care of her?

189
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:10,283
Mi-sol is getting jealous again.

190
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,671
Attention.

191
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:17,590
Han Ba-tang and Bu Ro-woon,
please come to the principal's office.

192
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:18,581
Come on!

193
00:14:22,605 --> 00:14:26,996
Why are you doing something
you shouldn't do, Na Yi-soo?

194
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:28,068
You fool.

195
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,430
Oh, what is that?

196
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:35,819
Nothing.

197
00:14:36,282 --> 00:14:37,305
It's suspicious.

198
00:14:37,606 --> 00:14:40,682
- Are you hiding food?
- Damn, hey, hey!

199
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:47,420
- Isn’t this a lip tint for girl?
- I don't like it!

200
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,156
I didn't say anything...

201
00:14:51,316 --> 00:14:52,759
It's not for me!

202
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:54,394
Give it to me!

203
00:14:54,597 --> 00:14:56,329
Why are you blushing?

204
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,265
- Give it to me.
- What are you doing?

205
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:02,392
- No...
- Ho-kyu is...

206
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:06,139
...giving you something.

207
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:08,478
- To me?
- Me?

208
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:15,546
Ho-kyu.

209
00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:19,629
We are just friends.

210
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:22,777
If you do this to me...

211
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:25,291
...how do I look at you
without feeling burdened?

212
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:28,428
- No, no...
- This punk...

213
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,431
You're a boy, don't be embarrassed.

214
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,200
I'll leave you two to talk.

215
00:15:35,303 --> 00:15:36,303
What?

216
00:16:00,912 --> 00:16:02,528
What happened?

217
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:04,964
You're asking what happened?

218
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,968
You got used to get compliments
so you don't know what happened?

219
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,372
Don't you know if you do this,
you'll be in big trouble?

220
00:16:14,114 --> 00:16:15,114
What?

221
00:16:26,222 --> 00:16:29,056
Has the victim been asked
for money by the perpetrator...

222
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:33,059
...since entering Balhae High School?

223
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:37,763
Yes.

224
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:46,672
Is it also true that you were
assaulted several times?

225
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:48,854
Yes.

226
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,476
It's not true!

227
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:54,380
Please continue with
the victim's statement.

228
00:16:54,942 --> 00:16:57,650
- I assaulted her?
- Sit down!

229
00:16:58,524 --> 00:17:02,690
Is this your way to solve a problem?
By making things up?

230
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:07,650
So is it okay for a taekwondo champion
to harass his friend like this?

231
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,771
Ba-tang.

232
00:17:19,325 --> 00:17:20,506
You didn't do it!

233
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:24,577
No one believes me,
so what should I do?

234
00:17:43,886 --> 00:17:46,967
You're doing well.
Why you look so sad?

235
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:49,669
Let's be friends from now on.

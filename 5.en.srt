1
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:03,737
- Expel him from school.
- What?

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,373
Even if everyone in the world
is against me...

3
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:08,709
...my father has to be
on my side, isn't it right?

4
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:13,680
Hey, why are you walking around
in the rain?

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,016
Didn’t you hear it’s going to rain today?

6
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:41,577
MOON SUNG-HYUN

7
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,581
KIM SHI-KYUNG

8
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,251
HYUN-SUK

9
00:00:49,653 --> 00:00:53,087
HWANG HYE-JIN, CHA JUN-HYUK,
CHOI JI-HYE, LEE HYO-BIN

10
00:00:53,757 --> 00:00:57,424
KIM KYUNG-MIN, KI HYUN-WOO,
KIM WON-HOON, LEE CHANG-HO

11
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,603
THE CHAIRMAN IS LEVEL 9

12
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:13,609
PLACES, CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

13
00:01:13,954 --> 00:01:16,877
Are you guys tired because midterm exam
is just around the corner?

14
00:01:17,274 --> 00:01:19,212
Yes.

15
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:23,459
You just have to be patient,
because the mock exam is waiting.

16
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:27,955
What would you do?

17
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:31,249
I pity you, but you must do this
to achieve your dreams.

18
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:34,342
If possible, let's think
positively, okay?

19
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:36,097
Yes!

20
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,602
Just in case, this is something
that shouldn't happen...

21
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,838
...but we don't want to
end up failing in our class.

22
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,963
Let’s fight together to prevent
something like that from happening!

23
00:01:47,996 --> 00:01:49,621
Yes...

24
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:55,667
We wish victory! We want 100 points!
We wish the best! We wish first place!

25
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,355
Balhae! Go! Yeah!

26
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:02,074
- Let's fight together!
- Yes!

27
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,246
Hey, why are you walking around
in the rain?

28
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,941
I'm just amazed.

29
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:25,195
You study so hard.
What do you want to be?

30
00:02:26,574 --> 00:02:27,574
A doctor.

31
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,550
Doctor?

32
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,590
It spells...

33
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:40,427
D-A-C-H-E-R?

34
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,233
You pronounce it "dakchyeo" (shut up).

35
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,837
Anyway, that's cool.

36
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:51,805
The doctor wearing a lab coat.

37
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:55,542
Today I will save this patient.

38
00:02:59,691 --> 00:03:00,881
They earn a lot of money.

39
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:04,158
It's that all?

40
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:07,502
Do I need more reason?

41
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:11,422
There are many things to do
to make a lot of money.

42
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,560
What?

43
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:16,697
Starting a startup in your 20's
and becoming a CEO?

44
00:03:18,653 --> 00:03:21,768
Or take over your dad's company and
become a second-generation chaebol?

45
00:03:24,691 --> 00:03:28,676
For people like me, there is no better way
to make a lot of money than doing a job.

46
00:03:30,996 --> 00:03:36,016
Ba-tang, principal is telling the student
council executives to gather at once.

47
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:37,793
So sudden?

48
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:40,387
What's going on?

49
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,637
Let's go.

50
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:53,741
So, the new chairman
emphasizes innovation…

51
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:55,937
…for the school's competitiveness.

52
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,917
Principal, do you know how much
our SR Group spent on...

53
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,346
...supporting Balhae High School
until last year?

54
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:10,026
Yes, I know it.
I always thank you.

55
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:14,054
Actually, I thought Korea
was too small for Se-ra.

56
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:18,479
Of course, I wanted to send her
to the United States to study...

57
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:23,830
...but she was so stubborn and I
end up enrolled her in Balhae High.

58
00:04:24,278 --> 00:04:28,101
But, you feed Se-ra cheap meals...

59
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,405
...and have someone who doesn't
look like a teacher to teach her.

60
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,240
What on earth is going on?

61
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:39,913
If this is going to be the case,
why were the student council elected?

62
00:04:41,512 --> 00:04:47,370
We also requested a meeting,
but there was no way to meet the chairman.

63
00:04:47,484 --> 00:04:50,401
Stop it, I beg you, please...

64
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:53,527
Please don't make me
come to you for this!

65
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:57,497
My perspective on Balhae High
has changed a lot.

66
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,003
It's important to maintain
the school's image.

67
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:10,801
It's time to show that this school
is for the upper crust of the society!

68
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,047
I am sorry.

69
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:19,386
I feel the elite image of this school
has been faded because of kids like me.

70
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:25,192
I don't know why amazing people like you
keep paying attention to people like me.

71
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:30,297
Principal, did you see her talking?

72
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,835
The school becomes like this
because of the entitled kids like her.

73
00:05:36,805 --> 00:05:39,129
She doesn't know
the tuition is expensive.

74
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,340
I don't know.

75
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:46,446
It seems the other students
have a greater sense of entitlement.

76
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,583
Because they have a top
law firm behind them...

77
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:53,086
...they think they can bully
the other the kids.

78
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:58,058
Ro-woon, I'm saying this
because I'm thinking of your parents.

79
00:05:58,644 --> 00:06:03,296
In a situation like this, there's
nothing good about taking their side.

80
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:10,403
I thought you called me here because
you wanted to hear the students' opinions.

81
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,406
But if you're just saying
what you want to say...

82
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,576
...I don't think there's any need
for me to sit here.

83
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,353
I guess the conversation
is already over?

84
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,690
What?

85
00:06:32,832 --> 00:06:33,872
It's a library.

86
00:06:35,191 --> 00:06:39,409
So the new chairman
will be replaced by Uncle...

87
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,736
I mean, Chairman Na-jun came to visit?

88
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,741
Even Se-ra's mother came
as a strong supporter.

89
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:53,113
So, that person is the late chairman’s
older brother, right?

90
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,181
Yes, he is.

91
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:58,385
He looked really scary.

92
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:03,551
In the meantime, is it true that
the chairman still doesn't show up?

93
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:06,564
I think...

94
00:07:09,674 --> 00:07:12,699
I think he's going to be a huge...

95
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:15,313
Is it worth it?

96
00:07:15,346 --> 00:07:17,570
What do you mean?

97
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,940
People with protagonist syndrome.

98
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,544
Even though no one is interested, he hides
his identity and then shows up suddenly.

99
00:07:26,971 --> 00:07:28,938
What do you mean
protagonist syndrome?

100
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:31,584
There may be some circumstances!

101
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,153
Be quiet, please!

102
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:35,221
Why are you so angry?

103
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,290
People might think that you know him.

104
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,163
Old geezers.

105
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,667
Why are they so interested
in this school?

106
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:51,004
They are so freaking greedy...

107
00:07:58,455 --> 00:08:01,016
- You will wear this?
- I'm jealous.

108
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:04,317
It's cute. It's all for me.

109
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:11,024
What’s in our Eun-bin’s pouch?

110
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,610
This is What’s in My Bag.

111
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:15,142
Stay still.

112
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:21,101
Eun-bin.

113
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:25,372
Why does a girl who doesn’t usually wear
makeup carry around so much cosmetics?

114
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,941
You're pretty without makeup.

115
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,312
Why there are so many things here?

116
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
Sorry.

117
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,617
The pouch is open,
and all are falling.

118
00:08:38,003 --> 00:08:40,587
Why are you doing such a nonsense?

119
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,932
Eun-bin, why are you
looking like that?

120
00:08:53,378 --> 00:08:55,869
They fell because
your pouch is too small.

121
00:08:57,174 --> 00:08:59,986
Why are you bringing so much
useless makeup?

122
00:09:06,248 --> 00:09:07,247
Na Yi-soo?

123
00:09:07,703 --> 00:09:08,718
Hey.

124
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,351
You look pretty in camera.

125
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,520
Prettier than in person.

126
00:09:13,768 --> 00:09:14,821
Who asked you?

127
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:18,825
Just mind your own business
and go away.

128
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,796
I'm now a student at Balhae High School,
so it's my business, too.

129
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,132
Why are you doing this?

130
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,307
Just because. Do I need a reason?

131
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:37,285
Just because...

132
00:09:39,694 --> 00:09:42,048
I don't like how she gazes at me.

133
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:46,319
If you don't have much,
you need to be humble.

134
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:50,124
But when I tell her to do something,
she always say no.

135
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,366
I'm starting to feel bad
looking at you right now.

136
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,002
Did you learn something from this?

137
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,872
Hey, do you know who this girl is?

138
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,441
I know her.

139
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,076
She's a daughter of a chaebol.

140
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:12,878
But so what?

141
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,603
Do you know?

142
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,166
You can't touch me.

143
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,128
I've always been able to do
what I want to do.

144
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:32,348
So, good job.

145
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,811
What should I do with this?

146
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:49,883
They are completely destroyed...

147
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,257
Thank you.

148
00:10:58,464 --> 00:10:59,660
I got it.

149
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,362
Let go of me.

150
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:24,250
What do you think?
It's a new release.

151
00:11:27,347 --> 00:11:28,788
I think it's similar.

152
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:32,725
You absolutely have no taste.

153
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:37,430
This is Pat and Mat, Pink Youth series,
Pink Sakura Blooming,

154
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:43,176
And that's the red that I secretly stole
from my cousin with 99% moisturizer.

155
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,243
Is that the name?

156
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:53,446
You need to know these things
to win a woman’s hearts.

157
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:09,762
I don’t know if you are carrying the bag
or the bag is carrying you.

158
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:15,268
I've been doing this
for a year and a half.

159
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:20,873
When I finish my college entrance exam,
I will burn all these reference books...

160
00:12:21,444 --> 00:12:23,142
...and dance in front of it.

161
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:37,090
Hey, give it to me.
It's my bag, I'll carry it.

162
00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:42,362
No. If this continues, you will soon
become a turtle before the CSAT.

163
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:48,735
I really don't like when men
carry women's bags.

164
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:53,039
Isn’t it a bit different
from that picture?

165
00:12:54,243 --> 00:12:57,310
My gosh!
When did you grow up like this?

166
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:01,056
Let's go.

167
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:13,996
Is that Yi-soo and Eun-bin?

168
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:16,789
Yeah.

169
00:13:17,978 --> 00:13:19,465
What's happening with them?

170
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:32,578
This is a kind of mess.

171
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:35,515
Na Yi-soo.
You can't answer one of those?

172
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,518
How come you can't do anything right?

173
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:41,821
If you keep on going like this,
you will definitely fail.

174
00:13:43,164 --> 00:13:45,425
Those eyes. Don't give me that stare!

175
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,961
Don't do it again.
Go back to your desk.

176
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:56,913
Ro-woon, solve this problem.
Try to solve it with this formula.

177
00:13:56,946 --> 00:13:59,600
Focus! How will you solve it?

178
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:00,673
Are you okay?

179
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:04,629
I can't do anything right?

180
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:09,015
Should I show you
what I am really good at?

181
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:14,120
Crazy.

182
00:14:22,258 --> 00:14:24,459
What we're gonna learn?

183
00:14:24,492 --> 00:14:27,400
Aren’t we in coding class now?

184
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,205
Well, I was so flustered
that I wondered if this was right.

185
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,775
The principal said we must
follow global trends.

186
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,679
What kind of subject you want to do?

187
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,748
League of Legends.

188
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:45,084
Do you know how much money
those professional gamers earn?

189
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:45,953
CHAIRMAN

190
00:14:47,456 --> 00:14:52,692
But protests from parents have
increased significantly lately.

191
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,221
If they read the article, they will see...

192
00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:00,032
But to teach how to play a game...

193
00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:02,068
I am the school owner.

194
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:06,672
You don't want an uncompetitive school
that can't keep up with trends, right?

195
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:16,816
So, the outcome of the game is decided
by something at the top of tower.

196
00:15:17,254 --> 00:15:18,718
Try...

197
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:19,986
Teacher.

198
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:21,988
It's Tryndamere.

199
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,223
Yeah, Tryndamere.

200
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:26,526
The Tryndamere...

201
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:31,264
Gaining the upper hand with
a successful dive in lane...

202
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:33,032
CS?

203
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,468
Teacher.

204
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,372
Don’t you know that
CS changes the game?

205
00:15:39,987 --> 00:15:44,277
It's the most basic thing,
but you don't know that.

206
00:15:45,746 --> 00:15:48,314
I know that. Let's get focus.

207
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:54,038
- Let's do hit.
- Hit?

208
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:55,855
Do we need to do this?

209
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:58,210
It goes into the performance
evaluation score.

210
00:15:58,243 --> 00:15:59,759
We have to do our best.

211
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,028
It's not a simple game.

212
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:06,265
Something insignificant can determine
whether you win or lose the game.

213
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,703
Ba-tang, you are doing great.

214
00:16:14,922 --> 00:16:17,983
Triple kill, quadra kill, penta kill...

215
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:19,412
Finish.

216
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,329
You caught them all by yourself.

217
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,718
Well, it's kind of fun.

218
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,690
Hey, this isn't your first time
doing this, right?

219
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,860
What do you mean? You saw me
creating my ID earlier, right?

220
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:35,761
Let's do one more round.

221
00:16:37,484 --> 00:16:40,199
Let's make it interesting.
Should we make a bet?

222
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:42,201
Go!

223
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,438
BA-TANG'S TTEOKBOKKI

224
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:45,338
Mom!

225
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,014
Good afternoon!

226
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,861
- Auntie, we came.
- My kids are coming?

227
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,651
Please give us all tteokbokki today.

228
00:16:52,716 --> 00:16:56,666
Mi-sol, didn’t I tell you to save
your allowance?

229
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:59,218
He will treat us all!

230
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,953
Hey, won't you come in?

231
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:10,963
It's the first time I see your friend.

232
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:15,026
You won the bet, but you choose
to eat tteokbokki for dinner?

233
00:17:15,153 --> 00:17:18,387
Hey! This tteokbokki is really good.

234
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:23,442
I know tteokbokki is delicious,
but let's go out.

235
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,812
I know a restaurant
that has one Michelin star...

236
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,382
It's Ba-tang's mother's diner.

237
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:44,530
I'm sorry. The only thing
I want to eat is tteokbokki.

238
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,843
Please make delicious tteokbokki
for four people.

239
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:53,806
Here is delicious tteokbokki
for four people!

240
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:59,412
Hey! School kids don't have money
to eat in a Michelin star restaurant!

241
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:04,116
I won't pay attention,
so just scoop up the oden soup, okay?

242
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,796
- Yes.
- Eat a lot.

243
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:08,487
Thank you for the food.

244
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,423
Eat a lot.

245
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,366
It's crazy, right?

246
00:18:20,469 --> 00:18:23,936
Ba-tang's tteokbokki is the most
delicious in Korea.

247
00:18:24,865 --> 00:18:28,163
Auntie, please tell me
how to make it.

248
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:30,242
You really want to know?

249
00:18:30,891 --> 00:18:32,731
What should I do?

250
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,681
If you want to know,
you have to be my son-in-law.

251
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,883
Mom!

252
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,953
Let me think about it.

253
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:44,671
Ro-woon, you should go to medical school
and think about saving people.

254
00:18:44,704 --> 00:18:48,494
If you say something like that,
you will get scolded by your parents.

255
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:54,166
Ba-tang is very popular
because she looks like her mother.

256
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,949
How are you?

257
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:11,600
Oh, Mister Yoo and Miss Baek.

258
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:12,703
- You are here.
- How are you?

259
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:13,750
Have a seat.

260
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:16,589
You should have told us
you invited us to this fancy place.

261
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:19,625
- So we could dress up a little.
- Oh gosh.

262
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:22,259
- Miss Baek, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

263
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:23,853
We'll have a drink together.

264
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:26,431
Are your exam preparations going well?

265
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:28,854
It's not something new for us.

266
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:31,303
Miss Baek, get a drink too.

267
00:19:32,856 --> 00:19:35,941
I can't drink alcohol.

268
00:19:36,747 --> 00:19:38,277
Oh gosh.

269
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:42,448
Young people these days
have clear preferences.

270
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:46,229
When I was young, we just poured it
into a bucket and drank it together.

271
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:47,987
Really?

272
00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:50,623
By the way...

273
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:55,761
Miss Baek, your contract
lasts until this year, right?

274
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,729
Yes, I'll take a drink.

275
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:04,939
Miss Baek, it's not like
you're just oblivious.

276
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,275
Okay. Let's have a toast.

277
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:13,814
Go to Balhae High School
with the energy of success!

278
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:18,009
- I'm a little late, Principal.
- Oh my...

279
00:20:18,145 --> 00:20:20,086
Teachers are already here.

280
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,255
I was just about to make
a toast, Chairman.

281
00:20:23,588 --> 00:20:25,524
Oh gosh.

282
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,159
I'm not a chairman yet.

283
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,528
I'm the chairman-to-be...

284
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,023
Please have a seat.

285
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:41,926
The reason I asked to meet
the teachers like this...

286
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:48,080
I think I need some help from you.
